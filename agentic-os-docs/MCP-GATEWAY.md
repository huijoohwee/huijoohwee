# MCP Gateway

The Agentic Canvas OS gateway is discovery-first federation over existing MCP surfaces. It is not a fifth monolithic proxy and must not duplicate dispatch logic already owned by local or control-plane servers.

## Federated Surfaces

| Surface | Role | Trust boundary | Token spend |
|---|---|---|---:|
| Local stdio MCP | Richest local/dev tool surface | Local workstation | 0 for discovery |
| Pages HTTP MCP | Read-only public discovery and source fetch | Cloudflare Pages | 0 for discovery |
| Browser WebMCP | In-page inspection and local browser surface | Browser session | 0 for discovery |
| MainPanel MCP | Browser-local readiness and non-secret setup view for Knowgrph-owned and external tool servers | Browser session | 0 for discovery |
| Cloudflare McpAgent | Approval-gated control-plane orchestration where deployed | Cloudflare Worker | 0 for discovery; spend only behind gates |

## Federation Rules

- Capabilities are deduplicated by `toolId`.
- Every capability lists `sourceCatalogs[]`.
- Optional unreachable catalogs are reported in `unreachableCatalogs[]`; they do not fail local discovery.
- Read-only discovery never invokes paid models.
- Spend-bearing orchestration routes through approval-gated control-plane owners.
- Browser-local surfaces never own provider secrets.
- MainPanel MCP renders Knowgrph-owned server templates, provider-neutral external-server templates, session-scoped allowlist rules, and deferred-tool bridge routes; it does not execute tools or store credentials.
- New remote proxies require an ADR with TCO, token, latency, and schema-drift comparison.

## Tool Gateway Capabilities

Tool capabilities expose callable functions and platform-scoped toolsets through existing `knowgrph` infrastructure. Gateway routing is one provider path for selected tools; it is not a fifth proxy, copied external registry, or Cloudflare deployment requirement for docs proof.

| Capability | MCP role | Default boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `knowgrph.tool.catalog` | List tool functions, toolsets, platform state, and per-tool gateway/direct/local/unavailable provider states. | Read-only; zero token discovery and no tool execution. |
| `knowgrph.tool.route` | Route one approved web, image, TTS, or browser tool call. | Schema, approval, egress, cost, and fallback checks run before execution. |
| `knowgrph.tool.provider.select` | Set non-secret provider preference per tool category. | Credentials stay server-managed; browser secrets are rejected. |
| `knowgrph.tool.gateway.audit` | Report routing, usage, cost, egress, approval, and deploy boundary state. | Read-only; no tool calls or deploy. |
| `knowgrph.toolset.enable` | Enable an existing logical toolset for one platform surface. | Requires tool policy, platform scope, and approval for risky toolsets. |
| `knowgrph.toolset.disable` | Disable a logical toolset for one platform surface. | Does not delete tool functions, credentials, history, or unrelated provider state. |
| `knowgrph.tool.search` | Search eligible deferred tool metadata from the current session catalog. | Opt-in bridge route; no schema disclosure, execution, or global registry scan. |
| `knowgrph.tool.describe` | Load one deferred tool schema on demand. | Schema must resolve from the current granted toolsets and policy. |
| `knowgrph.tool.call` | Invoke a selected deferred tool through a bridge. | Unwraps to real tool identity for schema validation, approval, hooks, audit, cost, and fallback. |

Tool Search capabilities are model-visible bridge routes for eligible MCP and non-core plugin tools only. Core direct tools remain exposed directly; deferred catalogs are rebuilt from session-scoped granted toolsets and cannot reveal disabled or out-of-scope tools.

## Soul Identity Capabilities

Soul identity tools are discoverable without model spend. Runtime prompt assembly remains gated behind scan, bounds, and typed fallback behavior.

| Capability | MCP role | Default boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `knowgrph.soul.load` | Read and validate durable identity from `SOUL.md` for prompt slot 1. | Read-only discovery is zero-token; prompt inclusion requires scan and bounds. |
| `knowgrph.personality.overlay` | Apply a temporary session-level voice or mode overlay. | Session-scoped; cannot mutate `SOUL.md` or bypass gates. |
| `knowgrph.soul.audit` | Check separation between identity, facts, agent rules, and memory. | Read-only; reports hardcoded identity or project-operation drift. |

## Learning Capabilities

Learning-loop tools are discoverable like other capabilities, but mutation remains approval-gated. Discovery must not call a model, optimize a prompt, write a skill, or persist identity facts.

| Capability | MCP role | Default boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `knowgrph.memory.write` | Add, replace, or remove bounded memory/profile entries. | Writes require scan, capacity check, target separation, and optional approval policy. |
| `knowgrph.memory.compact` | Consolidate bounded memory/profile targets before overflow. | Mutation is scoped; no silent drops. |
| `knowgrph.memory.search` | Read scoped memory and past conversation indexes. | Read-only; zero token discovery. |
| `knowgrph.session.search` | Search prior conversations on demand. | Read-only; results are not persisted automatically. |
| `knowgrph.user.profile` | Manage explicit user preferences, communication style, and expectations. | Writes require explicit evidence and reject unsupported inference. |
| `knowgrph.skill.discover` | List lightweight skill metadata without loading full skill bodies. | Read-only; zero token discovery. |
| `knowgrph.skill.load` | Load selected skill instructions and optional resources on demand. | Reads are bounded, scanned, and path-safe. |
| `knowgrph.skill.bundle` | Resolve grouped skills under one invocation. | Missing skills are reported; bundles do not install or bypass gates. |
| `knowgrph.skill.manage` | Create, patch, edit, delete, or update skill support files. | Writes require scan, validation, approval policy, and no-copy guard. |
| `knowgrph.context.discover` | Discover scoped project-local context files from working directory and touched paths. | Read-only; no model spend, no global scan, and no mutation. |
| `knowgrph.context.load` | Load one scanned and bounded context file. | Blocks injection, secrets, invisible controls, and over-budget content before inclusion. |
| `knowgrph.context.audit` | Report effective context precedence, skipped matches, blocks, truncation, and stale risks. | Read-only; context cannot override facts, identity, approval, or deploy gates. |
| `knowgrph.reference.expand` | Expand explicit inline `@` references into bounded attached context. | Supported surfaces only; sensitive paths, binary content, disallowed egress, and hard-limit overflow fail closed. |
| `knowgrph.reference.audit` | Report reference expansion source, size, warning, refusal, and truncation state. | Read-only; no extra fetch, mutation, memory write, or deploy. |
| `knowgrph.kanban.task` | Create or update one durable task row in `kanban.md`. | Uses shared table/Kanban utilities; no second board store. |
| `knowgrph.kanban.handoff` | Create one handoff row between named profiles. | Requires source profile, target profile, context refs, blockers, resume state, and acceptance. |
| `knowgrph.kanban.sync` | Reconcile board rows across full OS worker processes. | Read/write is conflict-aware and deploy-free. |
| `knowgrph.experience.capture` | Persist typed lessons from source-backed proof or operator correction. | Write requires explicit scope and no-copy validation. |
| `knowgrph.skill.propose` | Draft a new reusable skill contract from repeated experience. | Proposal-only until operator review. |
| `knowgrph.skill.evolve` | Evaluate and propose an improvement to an existing skill. | Human review required; direct auto-commit forbidden. |
| `knowgrph.identity.reflect` | Persist stable non-secret operator and project facts. | Operator authority required; unsupported inference rejected. |

## Mixture Of Agents Capabilities

MoA capabilities are discoverable without model spend. Runtime execution can fan out to multiple reference calls, so paid calls require approval and cost bounds before execution.

| Capability | MCP role | Default boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `knowgrph.moa.run` | Resolve local MoA preset, run bounded no-tool references, and return aggregator-owned response. | Discovery is zero-token; execution is approval-gated when paid calls are possible. |
| `knowgrph.moa.presets` | List local neutral MoA preset metadata without provider secrets or copied external examples. | Read-only; provider ids and credentials are not exposed. |
| `knowgrph.moa.cost` | Report reference token caps, aggregator tokens, cache hits, failures, and estimated cost. | Read-only cost view; no model calls. |

## Stateful Orchestration Capabilities

Stateful orchestration tools are discoverable without model spend. Runtime execution, checkpoint writes, human review continuation, and deployment remain approval-gated.

| Capability | MCP role | Default boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `knowgrph.orchestration.graph` | Validate source-backed state, node, edge, entry, exit, and stop-condition topology. | Discovery and dry validation are zero-token; mutation is gated. |
| `knowgrph.state.checkpoint` | Read or write scoped checkpoint and resume metadata. | Reads are scoped; writes require approval and recovery proof. |
| `knowgrph.human.review` | Surface interrupt payloads and accept approve, reject, or edit decisions. | Continuation remains blocked without operator result. |
| `knowgrph.stream.trace` | Stream ordered run, state, cost, and stop-condition events. | Trace is read-only, bounded, and secret-free. |
| `knowgrph.superagent.run` | Run bounded long-horizon research, coding, or creation over graph, workspace, message gateway, and artifact proof. | Discovery is zero-token; execution requires sandbox scope, checkpoint policy, stop condition, approval, and cost bounds. |
| `knowgrph.superagent.workspace` | Report sandbox workspace roots, allowed operations, artifact manifest, diff summary, scan state, and cleanup policy. | Read-only unless an approved run owns the workspace. |
| `knowgrph.superagent.messages` | Report typed user, agent, worker, tool, review, and artifact messages for a run. | Read-only ledger; cannot bypass tool, approval, cost, or deploy gates. |

## Gateway VCCs

| VCC | Check |
|---|---|
| Discovery is zero token | Cost log reports zero prompt and completion tokens for capability views. |
| Federation deduplicates | Tool ids are unique; duplicate declarations appear only in `sourceCatalogs[]`. |
| Optional remote failures are bounded | Unreachable remote catalogs appear in `unreachableCatalogs[]` without crashing local discovery. |
| No proxy duplication | No new server reimplements existing local or Worker dispatch without ADR. |
| Spend is gated | Any paid or mutating route requires the relevant approval gate. |
| Tool gateway is existing-infra | Tool routing uses local MCP, Pages HTTP MCP, Browser WebMCP, or approved control-plane owners; no new proxy is introduced. |
| Tool providers are per-category | Web, image, TTS, and browser categories each expose gateway, direct, local, or unavailable state. |
| Tool Search is scoped | Bridge routes search, describe, and call only deferred tools granted to the current session and never bypass real tool approval. |
| Tool secrets stay server-managed | Provider keys and browser sessions never appear in docs, client state, tests, or fixtures. |
| Soul identity is source-backed | Prompt assembly rejects silent hardcoded defaults and returns typed fallback for missing, empty, unsafe, or unreadable soul source. |
| MoA fan-out is bounded | MoA capabilities reject missing preset, uncapped references, recursive aggregators, and copied external preset examples. |
| Persistent memory is bounded | Memory capabilities reject unsafe writes, overflowing writes, mixed targets, unsupported profile inference, and silent compaction. |
| Skill loading is progressive | Skill capabilities expose metadata before full source, load resources on demand, and reject unsafe deep references. |
| Skill writes are gated | Skill management requires scan, validation, compatibility check, approval policy, and no-copy guard. |
| Context files are scoped | Context discovery uses explicit working directory and touched paths, scans before load, and keeps `FACTS.md` stronger than CLAUDE-style context. |
| Context references are bounded | Reference expansion preserves ordinary `@` bindings, scans sources, enforces workspace and egress policy, and emits warnings or refusals before attachment. |
| Kanban rows are durable | Kanban capabilities parse `kanban.md`, validate row schemas, preserve handoff evidence, and reject hidden process-only coordination. |
| Learning mutation is gated | Skill and identity writes require operator approval; discovery and search remain zero-spend. |
| External copy is blocked | Learning capabilities reject copied external code, prompts, schemas, tests, fixtures, and prose. |
| Stateful orchestration is bounded | Graph capabilities reject orphaned nodes, missing stop conditions, missing checkpoint contracts, and unbounded cycles. |
| Orchestration copy is blocked | Graph capabilities reject copied external runtime code, APIs, schemas, examples, tests, fixtures, and prose. |
| SuperAgent is bounded | SuperAgent capabilities reject missing sandbox scope, message gateway, checkpoint policy, stop condition, artifact manifest, and copied external runtime layouts. |
