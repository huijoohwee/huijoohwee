# Agentic OS Kanban

`kanban.md` is the durable shared task board for named profiles and full OS worker processes. It coordinates work through Markdown rows that existing shared multi-dimensional table and Kanban utilities can parse. It is not a copied external board runtime, a browser-only store, an in-process subagent swarm, or a deploy mechanism.

## Board Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Row SSOT | Every task, handoff, and sync state is a row in this file. |
| Named profiles | `owner_profile` and `target_profile` must name explicit profiles or `none`. |
| Full worker process | `worker_process` names an OS process, terminal, or `none`; hidden subagents are not workers. |
| Context refs | `context_refs` uses bounded references such as `@file:`, `@diff`, or local source ids; unsafe refs remain blocked by `@reference-policy`. |
| Shared utilities | Projection uses existing multi-dimensional table and Kanban utilities; no duplicate parser or board datastore. |
| Conflict handling | Concurrent edits preserve evidence and require explicit `/kanban.sync` resolution. |

## Task Rows

| id | type | status | priority | owner_profile | worker_process | target_profile | context_refs | acceptance | evidence | next_action |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KANBAN-0001 | task | ready | 1 | operator | none | none | `FACTS.md`; `SKILLS.md`; `DICTIONARY-*` | Kanban route contracts resolve from facts, dictionaries, memory, skills, harness, gateway, readiness, proof, and validation docs. | Source docs updated and focused validation passes. | Run docs validation after edits. |

## Handoff Contract

| Field | Required meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable task or handoff id. |
| `type` | `task`, `handoff`, or `sync`. |
| `status` | One of the frontmatter `row_statuses`. |
| `owner_profile` | Current responsible named profile. |
| `worker_process` | Full OS process identity or `none`. |
| `target_profile` | Receiving profile for handoffs or `none`. |
| `context_refs` | Bounded references needed to continue. |
| `acceptance` | Observable completion condition. |
| `evidence` | Proof already produced. |
| `next_action` | Smallest concrete continuation step. |

## VCCs

| VCC | Check |
|---|---|
| Board parses | Frontmatter parses and task table contains required columns. |
| Rows are durable | Task and handoff state is stored in Markdown rows, not process memory. |
| Profiles are named | Owner and target profiles are explicit or `none`. |
| Workers are isolated | Worker processes have identity, cwd/command outside this file, proof, bounds, and cleanup when launched. |
| Deploy boundary holds | Board edits do not mutate Prod mirror or deploy Cloudflare. |
