# Agentic OS User Profile

`USER.md` is the bounded profile contract for explicit operator preferences, communication style, and expectations. It is separate from `SOUL.md`, which defines the agent's identity and voice, and from `MEMORY.md`, which stores agent notes about projects, environment, conventions, and lessons learned.

This file is inspired by public bounded-memory systems, but it is a local Agentic OS source contract. Do not copy external memory code, database schemas, prompt renderers, sample entries, tests, fixtures, or prose.

## Profile Scope

| Profile field | Allowed content | Forbidden content |
|---|---|---|
| Preferences | Explicit operator preferences that affect future interaction. | Guesses, personality profiling, or sensitive traits. |
| Communication style | Explicit format, detail, tone, and review expectations. | Inferred emotional state or unsupported personal claims. |
| Workflow expectations | Stable expectations for approval, proof, cost, and boundaries. | Project commands, architecture rules, paths, ports, or deploy instructions. |
| Technical context | Explicitly stated skill level or tool comfort when useful. | Assumptions from one task or private/sensitive data. |

## Write Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Explicit evidence | Save only when the operator states a durable preference or approves a proposed profile entry. |
| Bounded capacity | Keep `user_profile_contract.limit_chars` enforced before writes. |
| No silent overwrite | Replacement requires a matching existing entry and a visible before/after summary. |
| No unsupported inference | Reject profile claims that are not grounded in operator statements. |
| No secrets | Never store credentials, tokens, private keys, payment data, or sensitive personal data. |

## Snapshot Contract

| Layer | Rule |
|---|---|
| Snapshot timing | Approved runtimes may inject a frozen `USER.md` snapshot at session start. |
| Mid-session writes | Writes persist for future sessions and tool responses, but do not rewrite the active prompt snapshot. |
| Capacity signal | Prompt or tool state should expose usage count and limit so the agent can compact deliberately. |
| Search | Historical sessions can be searched on demand; search results are not automatically profile entries. |

## Empty State

No profile entries are asserted by this file. Add entries only through `/user.profile` or an approved memory write with explicit operator evidence.

## VCCs

| VCC | Check |
|---|---|
| Profile parses | Frontmatter parses and `user_profile_contract.limit_chars` is present. |
| Profile is bounded | Any write checks character limit before persistence. |
| Profile is explicit | Entries cite operator statement or approval; unsupported inferences are rejected. |
| Profile is separate | Project operations stay in `AGENTS.md`; agent notes stay in `MEMORY.md`; identity stays in `SOUL.md`. |
| External reference is not copied | Diff contains local neutral contracts only and no Hermes memory code, sample entries, database schema, tests, fixtures, or prose. |
