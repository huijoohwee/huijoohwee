# Agentic OS Facts

`FACTS.md` is the shared truth layer for `agentic-os-docs`. Agents should read it before using local memory or role instructions. It is stronger than tool-specific helper files such as `CLAUDE.md` when those files exist in an adjacent environment, because this file defines repo-owned truth for this documentation control surface.

This file does not replace system, developer, or operator instructions. It defines the source-backed facts that local agents should reference consistently while working inside this docs folder.

## Layer Contract

| Layer | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUL.md` | Durable agent identity, voice, style, and communication defaults. | Project commands, architecture rules, memory persistence, deploy permission, or provider state. |
| `FACTS.md` | Shared truth, precedence, direct invocation definitions, deploy boundary facts. | Persistence, role prompts, command execution, provider state. |
| `MEMORY.md` | Bounded agent notes, environment facts, conventions, lessons learned, and reusable runtime-readiness memory. | User profile, top-level truth precedence, identity, or release authorization. |
| `USER.md` | Bounded user preferences, communication style, and expectations. | Agent identity, project operations, environment notes, secrets, or unsupported personal inference. |
| `SKILLS.md` | On-demand procedural knowledge contracts, progressive disclosure rules, skill variants, bundles, and skill write gates. | Separate runtime installation, copied external skills, provider secrets, or deployment authorization. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent roles, edit rules, validation behavior, forbidden patterns. | Source facts that contradict this file. |
| `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Slash command definitions. | Command runtime or parser fork. |
| `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md` | Hash semantic definitions. | Semantic registry fork or runtime-ready promotion by prose. |
| `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md` | At binding definitions. | Secrets, approval grants, or deployment authorization. |

## Precedence Facts

| Fact | Rule | Proof or source |
|---|---|---|
| Shared truth | `FACTS.md` is the first local docs file to consult for stable Agentic OS truth. | This file plus `README.md` document map. |
| Persistence | `MEMORY.md` persists local context and reusable routing memory after facts are known. | `MEMORY.md` frontmatter and body. |
| User profile | `USER.md` persists explicit operator preferences, communication style, and expectations separately from agent notes. | `USER.md` frontmatter and body. |
| Roles | `AGENTS.md` governs how agents edit and validate this folder. | `AGENTS.md` scope and validation sections. |
| Invocation grammar | `/`, `#`, and `@` tokens resolve through dictionary files, not prose-only UI labels. | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md`, `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md`, `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md`. |
| Primary identity inspiration | External SOUL systems are pattern references only. This repo may adopt a neutral durable identity contract that occupies prompt slot 1 when an approved runtime assembles prompts. | Official Hermes Agent SOUL docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Runtime status | `runtime-ready` requires surfaced proof; prose alone cannot promote external runtime claims. | `RUNTIME-READINESS.md` and `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`. |
| Deployment boundary | Dev, Prod mirror, and Cloudflare are separate. Prod and Cloudflare stay forbidden until explicit operator instruction. | `MEMORY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `RUNTIME-READINESS.md`. |
| Learning-loop inspiration | External self-improving agent systems are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for experience capture, memory search, skill proposals, bounded evolution, and identity reflection. | Official Hermes Agent docs and repositories listed in frontmatter. |
| Persistent memory inspiration | External persistent-memory systems are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for bounded agent notes, bounded user profile, frozen prompt snapshots, capacity errors, write actions, security scanning, and session search. | Official Hermes Agent memory docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Skills system inspiration | External skill systems are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for on-demand skills, progressive disclosure, bundles, managed writes, open-standard frontmatter, and resource loading. | Official Hermes Agent skills docs and Agent Skills specification listed in frontmatter. |
| Context files inspiration | External context-file systems are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for working-directory discovery, first-match project context, progressive subdirectory hints, security scans, truncation, and effective-context audit. | Official Hermes Agent context files docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Context references inspiration | External context-reference systems are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for explicit `@` message references that expand into bounded attached context on supported surfaces. | Official Hermes Agent context references docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Kanban collaboration inspiration | Context-reference patterns may inform how agents attach board rows or context refs, but the durable multi-agent board is local `kanban.md` plus shared table/Kanban utilities. | This file, dictionaries, `kanban.md`, and `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`. |
| Tool gateway inspiration | External tool gateways are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for per-tool routing, gateway/direct-provider selection, web search, image generation, text-to-speech, cloud browser automation, status, and usage. | Official Hermes Agent Tool Gateway docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Tools and toolsets inspiration | External tool registries are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for callable tool functions, logical toolsets, and per-platform enable or disable state. | Official Hermes Agent Tools and Toolsets docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Tool search inspiration | External tool-search layers are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for opt-in schema deferral, bridge search/describe/call routes, session-scoped deferred catalogs, and real-tool policy enforcement. | Official Hermes Agent Tool Search docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Mixture-of-agents inspiration | External MoA systems are pattern references only. This repo may adopt a neutral one-shot `/moa` contract for bounded reference-agent deliberation, aggregator-owned action, cost accounting, and prompt-cache-preserving context. | Official Hermes Agent MoA docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Stateful orchestration inspiration | External graph orchestration frameworks are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for graph state, nodes, edges, checkpoints, streaming traces, and human review. | Official LangGraph repository and docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Long-horizon SuperAgent inspiration | External SuperAgent harnesses are pattern references only. This repo may adopt neutral contracts for minutes-to-hours research, coding, creation, sandbox workspaces, memory, skills, tools, subagents, and message gateways. | DeerFlow repository listed in frontmatter. |
| Copy boundary | External code, APIs, prompts, schemas, examples, files, tests, fixtures, and prose must not be copied into this docs folder. | `AGENTS.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`. |

## Direct Invocation Definitions

| Token | Dictionary | Definition | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/soul.load` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for loading durable agent identity from `SOUL.md` into prompt slot 1. | Scan, bound, and inject `@soul-profile` before operational context; reject hardcoded silent defaults. |
| `/personality.overlay` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for temporary session-level voice or mode overlay. | Overlay may adjust style for a session but must not mutate `SOUL.md` or override facts, roles, memory, safety, or deploy gates. |
| `/moa` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | One-shot Mixture of Agents route for hard queries that benefit from multiple bounded reference-agent perspectives before one aggregator response. | Resolve a local preset, run references as advisory no-tool calls, pass private advisory context to the aggregator, preserve normal tool gates, restore prior model context, and log added token cost. |
| `#soul` | `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md` | Semantic route for durable agent identity and voice. | Keep identity broad, stable, source-backed, and separate from project operations. |
| `#primary-identity` | `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md` | Semantic route for prompt slot 1 identity replacement. | Resolve `@soul-profile` or return typed fallback; do not embed hardcoded identity in runtime code. |
| `#personality-overlay` | `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md` | Semantic route for temporary personality or style mode. | Session-only; cannot rewrite `SOUL.md` or bypass higher-priority instructions. |
| `@soul-profile` | `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md` | Binding for durable identity source. | Must be scanned, bounded, and non-operational. |
| `@identity-slot` | `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md` | Binding for prompt slot 1 identity position. | Must be filled from `SOUL.md` or a typed fallback result, not silent hardcode. |
| `@personality-overlay` | `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md` | Binding for session-level style overlay. | Must be temporary and subordinate to facts, roles, memory, and safety gates. |
| `/query` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Read-only command route for answering from `FACTS.md`, dictionaries, memory, and cited source docs. | Return source-backed facts or a typed gap; do not mutate files, spend tokens, or deploy. |
| `/memory.write` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for adding, replacing, or removing bounded memory entries. | Require target, action, evidence, capacity check, scan, and typed result before persistence. |
| `/memory.compact` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for consolidating memory when bounded capacity would overflow. | Merge or remove stale entries deliberately; never silently drop content. |
| `#mixture-of-agents` | `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md` | Semantic route for bounded multi-agent deliberation. | Require preset, reference-agent list, aggregator, cost bounds, no recursive MoA, and no copied external configuration. |
| `#reference-agents` | `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md` | Semantic route for advisory model or agent calls used before aggregation. | References are no-tool, bounded, private-context producers; failed references degrade without aborting unless policy requires fail-closed. |
| `#aggregator-agent` | `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md` | Semantic route for the single acting model or agent that produces the user-visible response. | Aggregator owns final answer, tool calls, approvals, and follow-up iteration through the normal harness. |
| `@moa-preset` | `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md` | Binding for a local MoA preset that names neutral reference and aggregator roles. | Must avoid hardcoded provider ids and reject recursive MoA aggregation. |
| `@reference-agents` | `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md` | Binding for bounded advisory calls in an MoA run. | Must be no-tool, capped, secret-free, and cost-logged. |
| `@aggregator-agent` | `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md` | Binding for the acting aggregator in an MoA run. | Must use normal tool schemas, approval gates, transcript persistence, and fallback rules. |
| `/session.search` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for on-demand search over prior conversations or session records. | Return cited matches without automatically promoting results into memory or profile. |
| `/user.profile` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for explicit user profile updates. | Save only operator-stated preferences, communication style, and expectations; reject unsupported inference. |
| `/skill.discover` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for zero-spend skill metadata discovery. | Return name, description, category, source, trust, and compatibility without loading full skill bodies. |
| `/skill.load` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for loading one on-demand skill and optional referenced resource. | Load full source only after selection; load referenced files only when required; reject deep reference chains. |
| `/skill.bundle` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for grouping several installed skills behind one command. | Resolve all listed skills, report skipped missing skills, and keep bundle instructions bounded. |
| `/skill.manage` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for create, patch, edit, delete, or supporting-file changes. | Require source evidence, scan, validation, operator review when gated, and no direct auto-commit. |
| `/context.discover` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for discovering project-local context files from a working directory. | Use scoped startup and touched-path discovery, first-match project context, zero model spend, and no mutation. |
| `/context.load` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for loading one scanned and bounded context file. | Scan for injection and secrets, truncate within policy, and return loaded or blocked state. |
| `/context.audit` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for inspecting effective project context and safety state. | Report precedence, loaded files, skipped files, truncation, stale risks, and proof without rewriting files. |
| `/reference.expand` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for expanding explicit inline context references into appended context packets. | Resolve only approved forms, preserve original message text, scan and bound content, and return typed warnings or refusals before injection. |
| `/reference.audit` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for inspecting context-reference expansion source, size, warnings, and safety. | Report supported platform, refused targets, truncation, source metadata, and proof without fetching or mutating extra content. |
| `/kanban.task` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for creating or updating one durable task row in `kanban.md`. | Validate row schema through shared table/Kanban utilities; require owner profile, status, evidence, acceptance, and next action. |
| `/kanban.handoff` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for writing one handoff row readable by another named profile. | Record from, to, task id, context refs, blockers, resume state, and acceptance without in-process subagent state. |
| `/kanban.sync` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for reconciling board rows across worker processes. | Preserve `kanban.md` as SSOT, surface conflicts, and avoid hidden worker memory as the source of truth. |
| `/tool.catalog` | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md` | Route for reading available tool categories and providers. | Return gateway, direct, local, and unavailable provider states with zero model spend. |

## Learning Loop Facts

| Fact | Rule | Proof or source |
|---|---|---|
| Tool gateway routing | Tool calls route through existing `knowgrph` infrastructure surfaces: local MCP, Pages HTTP MCP, Browser WebMCP, or approved Cloudflare control-plane owners. | `/tool.route`, `#tool-gateway`, `@tool-gateway`. |
| Tool functions | Tools are callable functions that extend an agent through typed schemas and existing runtime owners. | `#tool-function`, `@tool-function`, `/tool.catalog`. |
| Toolsets | Toolsets are logical groups of existing tool functions that can be enabled or disabled by platform. | `#toolset`, `@toolset`, `/toolset.enable`, `/toolset.disable`. |
| Platform scoping | A toolset enabled for one surface does not imply access from another surface. | `#platform-toolset`, `@platform-surface`, `@tool-policy`. |
| Tool Search eligibility | Tool Search defers only eligible MCP and non-core plugin tool schemas; core required tools stay direct. | `/tool.search`, `#tool-search`, `@deferred-tool-catalog`. |
| Tool Search catalog | The deferred catalog is session-scoped and rebuilt from current granted tool definitions; no stale global map is authoritative. | `@deferred-tool-catalog`, `#deferred-tool-schema`. |
| Tool Search bridge | Bridge calls unwrap to the underlying tool identity for policy, approval, hooks, audit, cost, and fallback. | `/tool.call`, `#bridge-tool`, `@bridge-tool`, `@tool-policy`. |
| Tool Search activation | Activation is opt-in or budget-threshold based and should disable below budget because bridge schemas and extra round trips have cost. | `#token-economics`, `#progressive-disclosure`. |
| Per-tool provider selection | Web search, image generation, TTS, and cloud browser automation choose gateway, direct, local, or unavailable provider state independently. | `/tool.provider.select`, `#tool-routing`, `@tool-provider`. |
| Tool catalog | Gateway status is discoverable without executing a tool or spending model tokens. | `/tool.catalog`, `@tool-provider`, `#tool-gateway`. |
| Web search | Search and extraction tools must return citations, source scope, egress state, and cost logs. | `#web-search`, `@web-search-tool`, `@tool-policy`. |
| Image generation | Image generation requires approval, provider/model choice, prompt bounds, artifact manifest, and cost log. | `#image-generation`, `@image-tool`, `@approval-gate`. |
| Text-to-speech | TTS requires voice/provider choice, text bounds, output manifest, and cost log. | `#text-to-speech`, `@tts-tool`, `@cost-log`. |
| Cloud browser | Cloud browser automation requires isolated session, action schema, screenshot or vision bounds, redaction, and approval gates. | `#cloud-browser`, `@browser-tool`, `@tool-policy`. |
| External pattern boundary | Hermes Tool Gateway and Tool Search may inform tool-category and deferred-schema semantics; local docs must not copy Hermes gateway code, tool-search code, retrieval implementation, bridge prompt text, provider tables, model lists, config examples, tests, fixtures, or prose. | `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, `MCP-GATEWAY.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`. |
| Skill discovery | Installed or authored skills are exposed first as lightweight metadata, not full prompt content. | `/skill.discover`, `#skill-system`, `@skill-index`. |
| On-demand load | Full `SKILL.md` content loads only when a selected skill is needed for the task. | `/skill.load`, `#progressive-disclosure`, `@skill-source`. |
| Resource disclosure | Supporting references, scripts, templates, and assets load only when the active skill explicitly requires them. | `/skill.load`, `@skill-reference`, `#agentskills-compatible`. |
| Skill bundles | Bundles group already-available skills under one route; they do not install missing skills or create a duplicate registry. | `/skill.bundle`, `#skill-bundle`, `@skill-bundle`. |
| Managed skill writes | Skill creation and evolution are review-gated procedural memory writes, not automatic runtime mutation. | `/skill.manage`, `/skill.evolve`, `@skill-policy`. |
| Open standard compatibility | Skill sources should preserve standard frontmatter, concise activation description, Markdown instructions, optional resources, shallow file references, and validation. | `#agentskills-compatible`, `SKILLS.md`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`. |
| Skill security | Skill load, install, and write paths must scan source, compatibility, environment requirements, copied artifacts, and dangerous instructions. | `#skill-security`, `@skill-policy`. |
| Context discovery | Project-local context files are discovered from the explicit working directory and touched paths, not from an unbounded global scan. | `/context.discover`, `#cwd-discovery`, `@working-directory`. |
| Context precedence | Only one project context type is effective per scope; skipped matches are reported rather than merged into duplicate instruction layers. | `#project-context`, `@context-policy`. |
| Context safety | Context files are scanned and bounded before inclusion; unsafe files return typed blocked state. | `/context.load`, `#context-file`, `@context-policy`. |
| Context hierarchy | `FACTS.md` remains stronger than CLAUDE-style context in this docs folder, and `SOUL.md` remains the separate identity layer. | `FACTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`. |
| Context references | Explicit `@file:`, `@folder:`, `@diff`, `@staged`, `@git:`, and `@url:` references may append bounded context to a message on supported surfaces. | `/reference.expand`, `#context-reference`, `@reference-policy`. |
| Reference safety | Reference expansion is workspace-scoped where applicable, blocks sensitive paths, rejects binary content, enforces soft warnings and hard refusals, and preserves raw text on unsupported surfaces. | `@attached-context`, `#inline-context`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`. |
| Reference warnings | Missing, invalid, unsupported, over-limit, or unsafe references produce typed warnings or refusals instead of silent mutation or downstream parser patches. | `/reference.audit`, `#attached-context`, `@runtime-proof`. |
| Kanban board | `kanban.md` is the durable shared task board for named profiles and worker processes. | `/kanban.task`, `#kanban-board`, `@kanban-board`. |
| Handoff rows | Every handoff is a row with source profile, target profile, task id, context refs, blockers, resume state, and acceptance. | `/kanban.handoff`, `#profile-handoff`, `@handoff-row`. |
| Worker isolation | A worker is a full OS process with its own identity and proof path, not a hidden in-process subagent. | `#worker-process`, `@worker-process`, `@agent-profile`. |
| Experience capture | Useful run traces may be summarized into typed experience records. | `/experience.capture`, `@experience`, `#learning-loop`. |
| Past conversation search | Agents may search local conversation or memory indexes when scoped by operator-approved storage. | `/memory.search`, `@memory-store`, `#memory-search`. |
| Skill creation | New skills start as proposals with source evidence, input/output schemas, bounds, cost fields, and VCCs. | `/skill.propose`, `@skill-catalog`, `#skill-evolution`. |
| Skill improvement | Skill evolution requires an evaluation packet, focused checks, semantic-preservation statement, and human-reviewed diff. | `/skill.evolve`, `@runtime-proof`, `#vcc`. |
| Identity model | Identity reflection stores stable operator preferences, project boundaries, and working rules; it must not store secrets or unsupported personal inferences. | `/identity.reflect`, `@identity-model`, `#identity-model`. |
| Self-modification boundary | Agents may propose and validate changes; they must not directly commit, deploy, or mutate protected stores without operator approval. | `@operator`, `@approval-gate`, `@dev-only`. |
| External pattern boundary | External systems can justify feature classes, but local contracts remain provider-neutral, FOSS-first, source-backed, and runtime-ready only after proof; context-file and context-reference parsers, prompt text, examples, tests, fixtures, and prose must not be copied. | `SKILLS.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`, `RUNTIME-READINESS.md`. |

## Persistent Memory Facts

| Fact | Rule | Proof or source |
|---|---|---|
| Agent notes | `MEMORY.md` stores bounded agent notes: environment facts, project conventions, tool quirks, completed-work lessons, and reusable techniques. | `/memory.write`, `#persistent-memory`, `@memory-store`. |
| User profile | `USER.md` stores bounded explicit operator preferences, communication style, and expectations. | `/user.profile`, `#user-profile`, `@user-profile`. |
| Target separation | Agent notes and user profile are separate targets; do not mix project environment facts into `USER.md` or personal preferences into `MEMORY.md`. | `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`. |
| Frozen snapshot | Approved runtimes may inject memory/profile as a frozen session-start snapshot; mid-session writes persist for future sessions and tool responses, not active prompt mutation. | `#frozen-snapshot`, `@memory-snapshot`. |
| Write actions | Memory write supports add, replace, and remove semantics through typed request fields, not separate parser forks. | `/memory.write`, `@memory-entry`. |
| Capacity management | Writes that exceed bounds must return a typed capacity error; the agent should compact, replace, or remove entries before retrying. | `/memory.compact`, `#memory-capacity`. |
| Session search | Past conversations can be searched on demand for specifics, but search results do not become memory until captured explicitly. | `/session.search`, `#session-search`, `@session-index`. |
| Security | Memory/profile entries must be scanned for prompt injection, exfiltration, secrets, invisible control characters, and unsupported inference before persistence. | `@memory-policy`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`. |
| External pattern boundary | Hermes Agent memory may inform layer semantics; local docs must not copy Hermes memory code, database schemas, sample entries, prompt renderers, tests, fixtures, or prose. | `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`. |

## Soul Facts

| Fact | Rule | Proof or source |
|---|---|---|
| Durable identity | `SOUL.md` owns who the Agentic OS agent is and how it speaks. | `/soul.load`, `#soul`, `@soul-profile`. |
| Prompt slot | Approved prompt assembly treats soul content as slot 1 identity before tools, memory, skills, project context, and overlays. | `#primary-identity`, `@identity-slot`. |
| No hardcoded default | Runtime code must resolve source-backed identity or return a typed fallback; it must not silently embed a hardcoded default identity string. | `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, `RUNTIME-PROOF.md`. |
| Separation | `SOUL.md` is for identity, tone, style, uncertainty, disagreement, and ambiguity defaults. Project rules stay in `AGENTS.md`; persistence stays in `MEMORY.md`; truth stays in `FACTS.md`. | `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`. |
| Overlay boundary | `/personality.overlay` is temporary session style and cannot mutate `SOUL.md` or bypass safety, facts, roles, approval, or deploy gates. | `#personality-overlay`, `@personality-overlay`. |
| Safety | Soul content must be scanned and bounded before prompt inclusion. Missing, empty, unsafe, or unreadable soul source yields typed fallback. | `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`, `SKILLS.md`. |
| External pattern boundary | Hermes Agent SOUL may inform layer semantics; local docs must not copy Hermes code, default identity text, personality preset text, prompt assembly code, schemas, tests, fixtures, or prose. | `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, `SOUL.md`. |

## Mixture Of Agents Facts

| Fact | Rule | Proof or source |
|---|---|---|
| One-shot invocation | `/moa` applies a local preset to the current prompt or scoped query and then restores the prior model or agent context. | `/moa`, `@moa-preset`, official MoA docs listed in frontmatter. |
| Reference stage | Reference agents run first, without tools, as bounded advisory calls over a trimmed deterministic context. | `#reference-agents`, `@reference-agents`. |
| Aggregator stage | The aggregator is the only acting agent; it produces the user-visible response and owns tool calls, approvals, and follow-up iterations. | `#aggregator-agent`, `@aggregator-agent`. |
| Private advisory context | Reference outputs are appended as private context for the aggregator, not written into source docs or exposed as separate truth. | `#mixture-of-agents`, `@runtime-proof`. |
| Cost and cache | MoA increases model-call count; reference outputs require token caps and cost logs, while stable prompt prefixes and cached context should be preserved. | `#token-economics`, `@cost-log`. |
| Failure handling | A failed reference can be represented as a typed advisory failure while the aggregator continues with available references, unless local policy requires fail-closed. | `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`, `SKILLS.md`. |
| Recursion boundary | An MoA aggregator must not be another MoA preset, and bare `/moa` must return usage instead of switching the global model. | `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`. |
| External pattern boundary | Hermes Agent MoA may inform routing semantics; local docs must not copy Hermes code, prompts, preset examples, schemas, tests, fixtures, or prose. | `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`. |

## Stateful Orchestration Facts

| Fact | Rule | Proof or source |
|---|---|---|
| Graph topology | Stateful orchestration is represented as typed state, nodes, and edges. | `/orchestration.graph`, `#orchestration-graph`, `@orchestration-graph`. |
| Durable execution | Long-running agents require checkpoint and resume contracts before runtime-ready promotion. | `/state.checkpoint`, `#durable-execution`, `@checkpoint-store`. |
| Human review | Human-in-loop stages are explicit interrupts with inspect, edit, approve, reject, and resume outcomes. | `/human.review`, `#human-in-loop`, `@human-review`. |
| Streaming trace | Agent runs may surface streaming events for progress and state transitions, but not as source mutation. | `/stream.trace`, `@runtime-proof`, `@cost-log`. |
| SuperAgent run | Long-horizon research, code, and creation tasks compose orchestration, skills, memory, tools, sandboxed workspace, message gateway, artifacts, and verification under one bounded harness. | `/superagent.run`, `#long-horizon-harness`, `@sandbox-workspace`, `@message-gateway`. |
| External pattern boundary | LangGraph and DeerFlow may inform graph and SuperAgent semantics; local docs must not copy external code, APIs, schemas, tests, examples, prompts, provider configs, runtime layouts, or prose. | `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`. |

## Resolution Rules

| Situation | Resolution |
|---|---|
| A local memory statement conflicts with `FACTS.md` | Update the source fact or demote the memory statement; do not layer an alias. |
| A role instruction conflicts with a fact | Keep the fact stable and update the role instruction unless higher-priority operator instructions say otherwise. |
| A dictionary token is missing | Add the token to the correct `DICTIONARY-*` file and cross-link it from this file. |
| A UI label looks like an invocation | Resolve through dictionaries before treating it as executable. |
| A claim needs runtime-ready status | Require `@runtime-proof`, focused validation, cost/deploy boundary reporting, and a bounded VCC. |

## Truth Tests

| VCC | Check |
|---|---|
| Facts parse | Frontmatter parses as YAML and `direct_resolution` includes command, semantic, and binding truth tokens. |
| Dictionaries resolve facts | The command, semantic, and binding dictionaries each include the matching direct-resolution token. |
| Roles are not facts | `AGENTS.md` points to `FACTS.md` for truth and keeps role/edit behavior separate. |
| Memory is not truth precedence | `MEMORY.md` describes persistence and routing memory without overriding `FACTS.md`. |
| Deploy boundary preserved | No Prod mirror or Cloudflare mutation is performed by documentation-only updates. |
