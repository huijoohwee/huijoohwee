# Command Dictionary

This file defines `/` command-route content for Agentic Canvas OS docs. It is a dictionary for shared invocation utilities, not a new command runner, parser, provider panel, or compatibility registry.

## Contract

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Route owner | Existing shared `/` utilities own command detection and replacement. |
| Dictionary role | This file names command intent, required context, and proof expectations. |
| Runtime status | Spec-complete until a shared runtime owner proves execution. |
| Spend policy | Malformed input, missing approval, or missing binding fails before paid calls. |
| Deploy policy | Prod mirror and Cloudflare commands remain gated until explicit operator approval. |

## Commands

| Command | Intent | Required bindings | Semantic filters | Completion signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/soul.load` | Load durable agent identity from `SOUL.md` as prompt slot 1 without hardcoding a default identity in runtime code. | `@soul-profile`, `@identity-slot`, `@runtime-proof` | `#soul`, `#primary-identity`, `#no-hardcode`, `#vcc` | Soul source parses, scan and bound result is typed, slot 1 identity is sourced or a typed fallback is returned, and no project commands or deploy grants are introduced. |
| `/personality.overlay` | Apply a temporary session-level style or mode overlay. | `@personality-overlay`, `@operator`, `@runtime-proof` | `#personality-overlay`, `#soul`, `#approval-gate` | Overlay is session-scoped, cannot mutate `SOUL.md`, and remains subordinate to facts, roles, memory, safety, and deploy gates. |
| `/moa` | Run a one-shot Mixture of Agents pass for a hard query without switching the global model or creating a copied provider preset. | `@moa-preset`, `@reference-agents`, `@aggregator-agent`, `@cost-log`, `@operator` when paid calls are possible | `#mixture-of-agents`, `#reference-agents`, `#aggregator-agent`, `#token-economics` | Local preset resolves; reference calls are no-tool, capped, and advisory; aggregator returns the only user-visible answer; tool calls use normal approval gates; cost log records reference and aggregator tokens; prior context is restored. |
| `/query` | Answer from `FACTS.md`, dictionaries, memory, and cited source docs without mutation. | `@agent`, `@source.body` | `#truth`, `#frontmatter`, `#vcc` | Response cites the owning source or returns a typed gap; no file mutation, token spend, Prod mirror change, or Cloudflare deploy occurs. |
| `/memory.seed` | Create or update a neutral memory block from source docs. | `@source.frontmatter`, `@source.body`, `@operator` | `#frontmatter`, `#no-hardcode`, `#vcc` | Parsed frontmatter and authored body memory block are present locally. |
| `/memory.write` | Add, replace, or remove a bounded memory or user-profile entry. | `@memory-store`, `@memory-entry`, `@memory-policy`, `@operator` | `#persistent-memory`, `#memory-capacity`, `#vcc` | Request names target, action, evidence, old text when replacing/removing, scan result, capacity result, and typed persistence result. |
| `/memory.compact` | Consolidate or remove stale entries when a bounded memory target is near or over capacity. | `@memory-store`, `@memory-policy`, `@runtime-proof` | `#persistent-memory`, `#memory-capacity`, `#vcc` | Compact result preserves durable facts, removes stale or duplicate entries, and returns before/after capacity without silent data loss. |
| `/memory.search` | Search scoped local memory or conversation indexes for reusable facts, decisions, and prior proof. | `@agent`, `@memory-store`, `@operator` | `#memory-search`, `#truth`, `#vcc` | Ranked results cite their source or return an empty typed result; no mutation, deploy, or paid call is implied. |
| `/session.search` | Search past conversations or session records on demand. | `@session-index`, `@operator` | `#session-search`, `#truth`, `#vcc` | Cited session matches return without automatically writing to memory or profile. |
| `/user.profile` | Add, replace, remove, or inspect explicit user-profile entries. | `@user-profile`, `@memory-entry`, `@memory-policy`, `@operator` | `#user-profile`, `#memory-capacity`, `#vcc` | Profile write is explicit, bounded, scanned, non-secret, and rejects unsupported personal inference. |
| `/skill.discover` | List lightweight skill metadata without loading full skill bodies. | `@skill-index`, `@skill-policy`, `@operator` | `#skill-system`, `#progressive-disclosure`, `#agentskills-compatible` | Index returns name, description, category, source, trust, and compatibility with zero model spend. |
| `/skill.load` | Load one selected skill source and optional on-demand resource. | `@skill-source`, `@skill-reference`, `@skill-policy` | `#skill-system`, `#progressive-disclosure`, `#skill-security` | Full skill source loads only after selection; referenced files load only when needed and shallow references validate. |
| `/skill.bundle` | Resolve a bundle that groups existing skills under one invocation. | `@skill-bundle`, `@skill-index`, `@skill-policy` | `#skill-bundle`, `#skill-system`, `#vcc` | Bundle resolves installed skills, reports skipped missing skills, and does not install or hardcode missing entries. |
| `/skill.manage` | Create, patch, edit, delete, or update supporting files for a skill. | `@skill-source`, `@skill-reference`, `@skill-policy`, `@operator` | `#skill-security`, `#skill-evolution`, `#agentskills-compatible` | Managed write is scanned, validated, review-gated when required, and returns a proposed or applied result with proof. |
| `/context.discover` | Discover project-local context files from the active working directory. | `@working-directory`, `@context-policy` | `#context-file`, `#cwd-discovery`, `#project-context` | Returns first-match startup context plus progressive subdirectory candidates with zero model spend and no file mutation. |

## Command Shape

```yaml
command:
  token: "/runtime-ready.check"
  role: "command route"
  input:
    source_ref: "@source.frontmatter"
    semantic_filters: ["#harness", "#vcc"]
  output:
    status: "runtime-ready | spec-complete | gated | blocked"
    proof_ref: "@runtime-proof"
  bounds:
    max_iterations: 1
    fail_before_spend: true
```

## Resolution Rules

| Situation | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Command is known and bindings are present | Route through the existing shared utility or runtime owner. |
| Command is known but binding is missing | Return a structured missing-binding response. |
| `/soul.load` finds missing, empty, unsafe, or unreadable source | Return typed fallback identity state; do not silently embed a hardcoded default. |
| `/personality.overlay` conflicts with facts, safety, or deploy gates | Reject the overlay before prompt assembly. |
| `/memory.write` or `/user.profile` exceeds capacity | Return typed capacity error and require `/memory.compact`, replace, or remove before retry. |
| `/session.search` finds relevant history | Return cited search results; require explicit `/memory.write` or `/user.profile` before persistence. |
| `/skill.load` references a supporting file | Load only the named shallow file under the selected skill root; reject deep or unsafe references. |
| `/skill.manage` would mutate a skill under approval policy | Stage or return review-required before writing; never auto-commit protected skill changes. |
| `/context.discover` finds several project context types | Apply one local precedence rule and report skipped matches; do not merge duplicate instruction layers. |
| `/context.load` finds prompt injection, secrets, invisible controls, or exfiltration content | Block before inclusion and return a typed blocked-context result. |
| `/context.audit` finds stale or conflicting project context | Report the conflict and fix the source file or shared owner; do not add a downstream remap. |
| `/reference.expand` targets sensitive, binary, missing, outside-workspace, or over-hard-limit content | Append typed warning or refuse expansion before injecting content. |
| `/reference.expand` runs on a platform that does not support inline expansion | Preserve the raw message and report unsupported-platform without rewriting the text. |
| `/kanban.task` or `/kanban.handoff` lacks a row id, owner profile, status, or acceptance field | Reject before write; do not create partial board rows. |
| `/kanban.sync` sees conflicting writes to the same row | Preserve both evidence fields and require explicit resolution; do not overwrite another profile's handoff. |
| `/tool.route` targets a paid, mutating, browser-auth, egress, or generated-media tool | Require `@operator` approval and fail closed without approval. |
| `/tool.provider.select` includes credentials or browser secrets | Reject and require server-managed secret setup; do not write secrets into docs or client state. |
| `/toolset.enable` would expose paid, mutating, browser-auth, egress, filesystem, terminal, or generated-media tools | Require `@operator` approval and scoped `@platform-surface`; fail closed without both. |
| `/tool.search` is enabled without a current deferred catalog | Return no-deferred-catalog; do not scan global tool registries. |
| `/tool.describe` targets a tool outside the session catalog | Return unavailable-for-session before schema disclosure. |
| `/tool.call` lacks described schema or real tool policy | Block before execution; never treat the bridge as approval. |
| `/moa` references an MoA preset as aggregator | Reject with a typed recursion error before token spend. |
| `/superagent.run` lacks sandbox scope, message gateway, checkpoint policy, or stop condition | Reject before execution; do not start an open-ended agent loop. |
| Command requires paid, mutating, payment, Prod, or Cloudflare action | Require `@operator` approval and fail closed without approval. |
| Command conflicts with source frontmatter | Fix the source or shared owner; do not add a downstream alias. |
| Command is unknown | Reject with a typed unsupported-command result and suggest nearest dictionary entries. |
