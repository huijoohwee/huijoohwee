# Runtime Proof

This ledger proves the local `agentic-os-docs` documentation control surface. It does not claim a Prod mirror write, Cloudflare deploy, paid provider call, or live external harness execution.

## Proof Scope

| Scope | Included | Excluded |
|---|---|---|
| Docs parse | Every Markdown file in this folder has YAML frontmatter and parses. | Instruction-only skipped files. |
| Route consistency | `/`, `#`, `@`, skill contracts, skill variants, and computing-flow entries resolve from source docs. | FloatingPanel-only duplicate registries or aliases. |
| Facts consistency | Every `FACTS.md` `direct_resolution` token resolves into the corresponding `/`, `#`, or `@` dictionary. | Memory-only or role-only truth precedence. |
| Soul identity contracts | `/soul.load`, `/personality.overlay`, matching `#` tags, matching `@` bindings, `soul.load`, and `personality.overlay` resolve from source docs. | Copied identity text, personality presets, prompt assembly code, hardcoded default identity strings, or live prompt runtime execution. |
| Persistent memory contracts | `/memory.write`, `/memory.compact`, `/memory.search`, `/session.search`, `/user.profile`, matching `#` tags, matching `@` bindings, and matching skill contracts resolve from source docs. | Copied memory code, database schemas, sample entries, prompt renderers, unsupported profile inference, or live memory runtime execution. |
| Skills system contracts | `/skill.discover`, `/skill.load`, `/skill.bundle`, `/skill.manage`, matching `#` tags, matching `@` bindings, and matching skill contracts resolve from source docs. | Copied skills, examples, layouts, prompt text, tests, fixtures, external repositories, or live skill runtime execution. |
| Context files contracts | `/context.discover`, `/context.load`, `/context.audit`, `#context-file`, `#project-context`, `#cwd-discovery`, `@context-file`, `@working-directory`, `@context-policy`, and matching skill contracts resolve from source docs. | Copied context discovery code, scanner code, example files, prompt assembly text, tests, fixtures, prose, or live context runtime execution. |
| Context references contracts | `/reference.expand`, `/reference.audit`, `#context-reference`, `#inline-context`, `#attached-context`, `@file:`, `@folder:`, `@diff`, `@staged`, `@git:`, `@url:`, `@reference-policy`, `@attached-context`, and matching skill contracts resolve from source docs. | Copied context-reference parser code, prompt section text, examples, tests, fixtures, prose, or live reference runtime execution. |
| Kanban collaboration contracts | `/kanban.task`, `/kanban.handoff`, `/kanban.sync`, `#kanban-board`, `#task-row`, `#profile-handoff`, `#worker-process`, `#multi-agent-collaboration`, `@kanban-board`, `@task-row`, `@handoff-row`, `@agent-profile`, `@worker-process`, and `kanban.collaborate` resolve from source docs. | Copied board runtimes, schema examples, hidden in-process subagent swarms, or live worker process execution. |
| Tools and toolsets contracts | `/toolset.enable`, `/toolset.disable`, `#tool-function`, `#toolset`, `#platform-toolset`, `@tool-function`, `@toolset`, `@platform-surface`, and matching skill contracts resolve from source docs. | Copied tool registries, platform presets, provider examples, config snippets, tests, fixtures, prose, or live toolset mutation. |
| Tool Gateway contracts | `/tool.catalog`, `/tool.route`, `/tool.provider.select`, `/tool.gateway.audit`, matching tool-category `#` tags, matching `@` bindings, and matching skill contracts resolve from source docs. | Copied gateway code, provider tables, model lists, config examples, tests, fixtures, prose, or live tool runtime execution. |
| Tool Search contracts | `/tool.search`, `/tool.describe`, `/tool.call`, `#tool-search`, `#deferred-tool-schema`, `#bridge-tool`, `@deferred-tool-catalog`, `@bridge-tool`, and matching skill contracts resolve from source docs. | Copied tool-search code, retrieval implementation, bridge prompt text, examples, tests, fixtures, prose, or live deferred-tool runtime execution. |
| Mixture-of-agents contracts | `/moa`, matching `#` tags, matching `@` bindings, `moa.run`, and `agent.moa` resolve from source docs. | Copied MoA artifacts, hardcoded external provider presets, recursive aggregators, uncapped fan-out, or live provider execution. |
| Learning-loop contracts | `/memory.search`, `/experience.capture`, `/skill.propose`, `/skill.evolve`, `/identity.reflect`, matching `#` tags, and matching `@` bindings resolve from source docs. | External copied implementation artifacts, unreviewed self-modification, or live optimizer execution. |
| Stateful orchestration contracts | `/orchestration.graph`, `/state.checkpoint`, `/human.review`, `/stream.trace`, matching `#` tags, and matching `@` bindings resolve from source docs. | Copied graph runtime artifacts, hidden graph stores, unbounded cycles, or live external runtime execution. |
| Long-horizon SuperAgent contracts | `/superagent.run`, `#long-horizon-harness`, `#sandboxed-workspace`, `#message-gateway`, `@sandbox-workspace`, `@message-gateway`, and `superagent.run` resolve from source docs. | Copied DeerFlow runtime layouts, prompts, provider configs, examples, tests, fixtures, unbounded loops, or live external runtime execution. |
| KGC computing-flow | Docs declare `kgc-computing-flow/v1`, explicit handles, bounded execution, and KGC validation ownership. | Separate chat-local flow engine or direct graph mutation. |
| Cost and gates | Documentation validation is zero model spend and keeps paid/mutating/deploy gates explicit. | Approved paid calls, payment, browser-auth, Prod mirror, or Cloudflare deploy. |
| Deployment boundary | Dev docs are changed locally only. | Prod mirror and Cloudflare runtime proof. |

## Revalidation

Run the focused commands in `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md` after any change to this folder. If a runtime owner in `/Users/huijoohwee/Documents/GitHub/knowgrph` changes, add the relevant focused `knowgrph` test or MCP proof before updating this ledger.
