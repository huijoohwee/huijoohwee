# Binding Dictionary

This file defines `@` binding-route content for Agentic Canvas OS docs. Bindings attach commands and semantic filters to an actor, source, runtime surface, proof artifact, or boundary. They are references only; they do not store secrets or authorize deployment.

## Contract

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Route owner | Existing shared `@` utilities own binding detection and insertion. |
| Dictionary role | This file names binding meaning, authority, and fail-closed behavior. |
| Runtime status | Spec-complete until a shared runtime owner resolves the binding. |
| Secret policy | Bindings never contain raw credentials, provider keys, browser sessions, or media tokens. |
| Deploy policy | `@prod-mirror` and `@cloudflare` are gated boundaries, not default edit targets. |

## Bindings

| Binding | Meaning | Authority | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@agent` | Executing agent bound by `FACTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and explicit operator instructions. | Current runtime agent. | Must consult facts before memory, keep role behavior separate from truth, and fail closed on spend, mutation, or deploy gaps. |
| `@soul-profile` | Durable source-backed agent identity and voice. | `SOUL.md` plus approved prompt-assembly owner. | Identity only; no project commands, architecture notes, file paths, ports, credentials, memory facts, or deploy approvals. |
| `@identity-slot` | Prompt slot 1 identity position. | Approved prompt-assembly owner. | Must be filled from scanned `@soul-profile` or a typed fallback result; silent hardcoded default identity is forbidden. |
| `@personality-overlay` | Temporary session-level style overlay. | Operator-approved session state. | Overlay cannot mutate `SOUL.md`, override facts, bypass safety, or authorize deploy. |
| `@moa-preset` | Local neutral MoA preset binding for reference roles, aggregator role, caps, and failover policy. | `FACTS.md`, `SKILLS.md`, and the approved local model router or harness owner. | Must not contain copied provider examples, hardcoded external model ids, recursive MoA aggregators, or global model-switch side effects. |
| `@reference-agents` | Bounded advisory agents in a Mixture of Agents run. | Approved local harness or provider router. | No tools, no source mutation, capped output, typed failure, cost logging, and private advisory context only. |
| `@aggregator-agent` | Single acting agent in a Mixture of Agents run. | Approved local harness or provider router. | Owns final answer, tool calls, approvals, transcript persistence, and follow-up iteration through normal gates. |
| `@operator` | Human approval authority and final release gate. | The user. | Required before paid, mutating, payment, browser-auth, Prod, or Cloudflare actions. |
| `@source.frontmatter` | Parsed YAML frontmatter. | Authored document source. | SSOT for identity, routing, renderer flags, and runtime gates. |
| `@source.body` | Authored Markdown body. | Authored document source. | SSOT for operator workflow, guardrails, and checklist language. |
| `@local-harness` | Dev-local typed harness or dry-run path. | Shared local runtime owner. | Default proof path before paid calls or deploy. |
| `@runtime-proof` | Surfaced validation evidence. | Command output, typed result, parsed field, or focused test. | Must be observable; narrative alone is not proof. |
| `@dev-only` | Local development boundary. | Current Dev worktree. | Confirms work stops before Prod mirror and Cloudflare. |
| `@cost-log` | Token, cache, and estimated cost ledger. | Harness observer or runtime result. | Must report exact zero for model-free views. |
| `@mcp-gateway` | Discovery-first MCP federation surface. | Existing local, Pages, browser, or control-plane MCP owner. | Discovery is zero-token; spend routes through approval gates. |
| `@canvas` | Source-backed Canvas projection. | Existing Source Files, frontmatter, KGC, table, or Storyboard owner. | No dashboard-only graph store or renderer fork. |
| `@approval-gate` | Explicit gate state for spend, mutation, payment, browser auth, or deploy. | Shared gate catalog or harness result. | Missing approval blocks before action. |
| `@prod-mirror` | Prod mirror path for release staging. | Operator-approved release flow only. | Not a default edit target; forbidden without explicit instruction. |
| `@cloudflare` | Cloudflare route or Worker/Pages control plane. | Operator-approved deploy flow only. | Not a completion criterion for docs-only work. |
| `@experience` | Typed record of a run, failure, proof packet, or operator correction. | Authored source plus surfaced runtime proof. | May seed proposals only after provenance, applicability, expiry risk, and no-copy boundary are recorded. |
| `@memory-store` | Bounded agent-note store for environment facts, conventions, lessons, and project context. | `MEMORY.md` plus approved local memory owner. | Read is scoped; writes require scan, capacity check, duplicate handling, and must exclude secrets, unsupported inference, and deploy artifacts. |
| `@memory-entry` | One compact memory or profile entry. | Approved memory write request. | Entry must name target, evidence, write action, scan result, capacity result, and source. |
| `@memory-snapshot` | Frozen memory/profile context captured at session start. | Approved prompt assembly owner. | Active prompt snapshot is immutable; mid-session writes affect future sessions or live tool responses only. |
| `@memory-policy` | Capacity, write approval, scan, duplicate, and compaction policy. | `FACTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, and approved runtime owner. | Unsafe, overflowing, duplicate, or unsupported writes fail closed with typed result. |
| `@user-profile` | Bounded user profile for explicit preferences, communication style, and expectations. | `USER.md` plus operator-approved profile owner. | No unsupported personal inference, secrets, sensitive profiling, project operations, or stale session details. |
| `@session-index` | Searchable past-session record index. | Approved local session-search owner. | Read-only search by default; results require explicit capture before persistence. |
| `@skill-index` | Lightweight skill metadata index. | `SKILLS.md` plus approved shared skill registry owner. | Index entries include metadata only; full instruction bodies and secrets stay out until selected. |
| `@skill-source` | One selected skill source document. | `SKILL.md`-compatible source under an approved skill root. | Must parse, remain bounded, avoid copied external artifacts, and load only after selection. |
| `@skill-reference` | Optional skill resource such as references, scripts, templates, or assets. | Approved skill root and resource path. | Load on demand, keep references shallow, validate before execution, and reject unsafe paths. |
| `@skill-bundle` | Bundle manifest that groups existing skill ids. | Approved bundle source. | Resolves installed skills, reports missing entries, and cannot override approval or deploy gates. |
| `@skill-policy` | Skill trust, scan, compatibility, write approval, and validation policy. | `FACTS.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, and approved runtime owner. | Unsafe external sources, incompatible requirements, copied artifacts, or unreviewed writes fail closed. |
| `@context-file` | One discovered project-local context file. | Working directory, ancestor, or touched subdirectory under the approved project scope. | Read-only unless operator requests edits; must scan, bound, and never override `FACTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, system, developer, or operator instructions. |
| `@working-directory` | Current startup or tool-call working directory used for context discovery. | Runtime session state or explicit operator path. | Must be explicit, normalized, and scoped; no home-wide or global scan unless approved. |
| `@context-policy` | Precedence, scan, truncation, and progressive-discovery rules for context files. | `FACTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, and approved runtime owner. | First-match project context, per-directory visited set, prompt-injection block, capacity bound, and deploy gate are required. |
| `@file:` | Context reference to one workspace file or 1-indexed line range. | Explicit message text plus normalized workspace path. | Text only, workspace-scoped, sensitive path blocked, path traversal blocked, binary rejected, and bounded before expansion. |
| `@folder:` | Context reference to a directory listing or bounded folder summary. | Explicit message text plus normalized workspace directory. | Maximum entry cap, no recursive content dump by default, sensitive children skipped with warnings. |
| `@diff` | Context reference to the current unstaged diff. | Current VCS worktree. | Read-only, secret-scanned, bounded, and never treated as approval to write or revert. |
| `@staged` | Context reference to the current staged diff. | Current VCS index. | Read-only, secret-scanned, bounded, and never treated as commit approval. |
| `@git:` | Context reference to recent commit metadata or patch range. | Current VCS repository. | Count is clamped to a small maximum, missing revisions warn, and sensitive content remains blocked. |
| `@url:` | Context reference to fetched external content. | Approved URL fetch/extract owner. | Requires egress policy, cache/citation metadata, size bounds, and no credentials in URL or headers. |
| `@reference-policy` | Workspace, scan, size, platform, URL egress, warning, and refusal rules for context references. | `FACTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `VALIDATION-RUNBOOK.md`, and approved composer or CLI owner. | Missing policy preserves raw text; unsupported surfaces pass raw `@` references through with typed warning. |
| `@attached-context` | Bounded appended context packet produced by reference expansion. | Approved `/reference.expand` runtime owner. | Packet records source token, normalized source, size, truncation, warnings, refusal, and cost posture. |
| `@kanban-board` | Durable `kanban.md` task board. | Authored Markdown table source plus existing multi-dimensional table/Kanban utilities. | Board rows are the SSOT for task and handoff state; no browser-only, process-only, or copied board store. |
| `@task-row` | One validated task row in `kanban.md`. | Shared table row parser and operator-approved task schema. | Requires stable id, title, owner profile, status, priority, acceptance, evidence, and next action. |
| `@handoff-row` | One validated handoff row in `kanban.md`. | Shared table row parser and named profiles. | Requires from profile, to profile, task id, context refs, blockers, resume state, and acceptance criteria. |
| `@agent-profile` | Named profile that can own or receive board work. | `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, profile config, or explicit operator-defined profile source. | Profile identity is explicit and non-secret; it cannot imply deploy, spend, or hidden memory ownership. |
| `@worker-process` | Full OS process worker for a named profile. | Approved local process launcher or operator-run terminal. | Process has cwd, identity, command, proof, cleanup, and resource bounds; no fragile in-process subagent swarm. |
| `@tool-gateway` | Existing `knowgrph` tool routing surface. | Local MCP, Pages HTTP MCP, Browser WebMCP, or approved Cloudflare control-plane owner. | No new proxy, no copied gateway, and no deploy claim without explicit approval. |
| `@tool-provider` | Provider state for a specific tool category. | Approved provider router or settings owner. | Gateway, direct, local, or unavailable state only; raw credentials stay server-managed. |
| `@tool-function` | One callable function that extends agent capability. | Existing MCP, local harness, browser, source, or control-plane owner. | Must declare schema, owner, risk class, cost posture, and typed fallback without secrets. |
| `@toolset` | Logical bundle of existing tool functions. | `SKILLS.md`, `MCP-GATEWAY.md`, and approved tool catalog owner. | Resolves existing functions only; cannot install, invent, or globally enable tools. |
| `@platform-surface` | CLI, FloatingPanel Chat, browser, MCP, or control-plane surface. | Approved runtime surface owner. | Toolset state is scoped to this surface and cannot grant cross-platform access implicitly. |
| `@deferred-tool-catalog` | Session-scoped catalog of eligible deferred tools. | Approved tool catalog owner assembled from current MCP and plugin toolsets. | Rebuilt from currently granted tools; cannot expose core direct tools, disabled tools, or global registry entries. |

| `@image-tool` | Image generation capability. | Approved image harness. | Requires approval, prompt bounds, artifact manifest, and cost log. |
| `@tts-tool` | Text-to-speech capability. | Approved audio harness. | Requires voice/provider, text bounds, output manifest, and cost log. |
| `@browser-tool` | Cloud browser automation capability. | Approved browser automation harness. | Requires isolated session, action schema, redaction, screenshots or vision bounds, and approval. |
| `@tool-policy` | Tool approval, egress, secret, cost, and fallback policy. | `FACTS.md`, `MCP-GATEWAY.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`, and approved runtime owner. | Paid, mutating, browser-auth, generated-media, and deploy actions fail closed without approval. |
| `@skill-catalog` | Reusable skill contract catalog. | `SKILLS.md` plus existing shared skill registry owner when present. | Skill changes are proposals until reviewed; direct auto-commit and external copying are forbidden. |
| `@identity-model` | Stable model of operator preferences, project boundaries, and agent operating rules. | `FACTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and operator-approved memory. | Stores non-secret, source-backed facts only; no sensitive profiling or unsupported personal inference. |
| `@orchestration-graph` | Source-backed state, node, edge, and stop-condition topology. | `SKILLS.md`, `HARNESS-CONTRACTS.md`, and existing Canvas/KGC graph owners. | No external graph runtime import, hidden node registry, or direct graph-store mutation. |
| `@state-store` | Scoped current-state snapshot for a stateful run. | Existing approved local state owner. | Typed, bounded, secret-free state only; writes require mutation approval. |
| `@checkpoint-store` | Durable checkpoint and resume surface. | Existing approved local persistence owner. | Checkpoints require scope, recovery proof, idempotency, and cleanup path. |
| `@human-review` | Operator review interrupt and resume binding. | The operator or approved review gate. | Continuation is blocked until approve, reject, or edit result is typed. |
| `@sandbox-workspace` | Scoped workspace for long-horizon agent file reads, writes, execution, uploads, and outputs. | Approved sandbox, local workspace, or per-run output owner. | Must declare root, allowed operations, diff summary, artifact manifest, secret scan, timeout, cleanup, and approval gates. |
| `@message-gateway` | Typed message bus for user, agent, worker, tool, review, and artifact events. | Approved local harness, MCP gateway, or control-plane owner where deployed. | Messages require schema, sender, recipient, run id, state transition, replay rule, and visibility boundary. |
