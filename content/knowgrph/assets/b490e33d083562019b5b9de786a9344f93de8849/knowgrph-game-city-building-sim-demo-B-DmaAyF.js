# Knowgrph City Simulation

This Source Files document is the derived local activation and proof projection
for a deterministic city simulation. Applying it requests \`cityBuilder\` and
Geo+XR Mode. The existing native MapLibre Geo host owns the geographic visual
renderer, camera, and viewport gestures. \`SemanticMediaFigure\` wraps that
geospatial projection directly as a labeled semantic City media stage; City
creates and activates zero Three.js/React Three Fiber stage, mesh, camera, or
pointer owner. Any retained shared Canvas remains invisible, inactive, and
pointer-transparent. MapLibre POI clicks and City Builder controls dispatch
to the same City Runtime selection owner.

The source parser initializes one POI-zoning state from this document. Its
\`regional_poi_profile_id\` resolves one immutable geographic profile whose
identities, exact rings, real-metre heights, accuracy, and provenance remain
solely in the selected companion. Every City \`parcel_id\` must equal exactly one
\`RegionalPoiIdentity.id\`, and the six rows must cover that selected profile
one-to-one in profile order. Row and column fields are deterministic UI order
only; they never generate, position, scale, rotate, or otherwise modify
geometry. \`kg-city-sim:geo-overlay\` projects only live zone and selection state
onto the companion-owned surfaces. City authors no geographic anchor,
dimensions, gaps, bearing, route, aircraft, or height.

The existing MapLibre host and regional POI utilities own geographic context
and camera framing. Existing Flight route and aircraft overlays remain
independently owned and may compose above City without City copying, adapting,
or activating Flight data. City does not project a Flight-local XR environment
or install Flight bootstrap, camera, padding, gameplay, controls, mission, or
readiness. City creates no duplicate map, source/layer ids, Canvas, renderer,
or parallel HTML POI marker layer.

City never starts the native XR physics playground. The Three renderer excludes
the authored/native graph for City source intent, and any retained shared
Canvas remains inactive, invisible, and pointer-transparent. One labeled
semantic \`figure\` wraps the native MapLibre
Geo+XR host directly. Its live MapLibre \`canvas\` carries the direct City
accessible name and the sole media-selection marker while City is active; the
figure keeps its \`figcaption\` but carries no competing selection marker. Neither
wrapper nor canvas adds \`aria-hidden\` or captures pointer input, so selection
tooling can identify the stage without stealing MapLibre gestures or City
Builder POI input. No generic replacement wrapper or regional HTML marker
creates a competing selection target.

The normative requirements live at
\`.kiro/specs/knowgrph-city-building-sim/requirements.md\`. This document does
not establish runtime readiness by declaration. Its status stays
\`proof-pending\` until focused tests and neutral browser evidence pass at the
exact candidate SHA.

## Authored initial POI zoning

The source parser must initialize the City Runtime from exactly this POI-zoning
table and the \`city_initial\` metadata in frontmatter:

\`\`\`csv
parcel_id,row,column,zone,land_value_cents,population,pollution
marina-bay-sands,0,0,residential,10000,10,0
singapore-flyer,0,1,commercial,9000,5,0
gardens-by-the-bay,0,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
esplanade-theatres-on-the-bay,1,0,industrial,7000,0,2
the-fullerton-hotel,1,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
raffles-hotel,1,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
\`\`\`

## Local use

1. Run the repository-owned development command.
2. Start from a browser with the native MapLibre basemap, no persisted city
   state, no URL selection, and no previously open city runtime.
3. Confirm City Builder is closed, the City media figure is presentational and
   inactive, and Flight gameplay is inactive.
4. Open Explorer -> Source Files and wait for bootstrap readiness.
5. Open this document and apply it.
6. Confirm Geo+XR Mode shows every companion-selected regional geographic POI
   surface at its exact rings and real-metre height plus one visible fixed-pixel
   identity locator and label per POI, with the six source-authored zoning
   states projected onto those exact surfaces. Confirm no City-authored
   geographic or Flight data exists and the camera frames the regional
   features. Then confirm City Builder opens with tick \`0\`,
   treasury \`100000\` cents, and population \`15\`.
7. If the existing Flight Geo overlay is present, confirm it remains
   independently owned and no City source field controls its route or aircraft.

The simulation does not auto-start and does not auto-save.

## Core loop

Select \`gardens-by-the-bay\`, assign a zone, Start, observe one committed tick,
then Stop.
The next tick uses the exact v1 coefficients in frontmatter. Stop must fence
queued ticks. Advice returns at most two local heuristic rounds and never
changes a parcel by itself.

Save writes only \`/game-city-sim/city-poi-zoning.md\`, reads that path back, compares
bytes and parsed state, and reports success only after both comparisons pass.
Malformed existing bytes remain untouched and block Start/Restart; Reset
restores this authored POI zoning in memory without overwriting the path.

## FloatingPanel checks

All projections must report the same runtime revision:

- Media: palette and regional POI zoning appearance;
- Animation: fixed-step playback;
- Motion Control: normalized input and selected regional POI;
- Game Mode: exclusive city-overlay state;
- Flight Sim: independently owned existing Flight overlay status with no
  City-authored aircraft or route;
- Camera: native MapLibre framing.

City Builder remains the complete editing surface. Exit restores the prior
FloatingPanel/Canvas surface state exactly once and neither captures nor
restores a Three camera.

## Validation status

- [ ] Focused economy, codec, Advisor, invocation, runtime, MCP, routing, and
  type checks pass at the exact candidate SHA.
- [ ] Neutral proof records City Builder closed and the City media figure
  presentational/inactive before applying this Source File, with no
  Flight-local XR environment source/layers, no
  \`kg-city-sim:geo-overlay\` source/layers, and no \`kg-geo-xr:regional-poi\`
  source/layers.
- [ ] Source application alone selects Geo+XR, retains one native MapLibre host
  wrapped by \`SemanticMediaFigure\`, and loads the authored POI zoning in City
  Builder.
- [ ] Six live POI zoning features render through the City source/layers;
  MapLibre clicks and City Builder controls share POI selection; one zone
  and selection mutation is visible; and zero City-created, active, or visible
  Three.js/R3F stage/mesh/camera mounts. Any retained shared canvas is inactive
  and pointer-transparent.
- [ ] The real native MapLibre basemap remains the only geographic renderer.
  The companion-selected regional geographic POI collection preserves its
  exact rings, real-metre heights, accuracy, and provenance below City parcels,
  plus one visible identity locator and label per POI; the MapLibre camera
  frames the selected POI profile. No selected
  Flight-local XR environment source or features exist in the City
  presentation. City authors no geometry, height, anchor, dimensions, gaps,
  bearing, route, or aircraft; independent existing Flight source/layers may
  compose above City without Flight bootstrap, camera, padding, gameplay,
  readiness, or duplicate
  map/source/layer ids.
- [ ] The native XR physics playground and authored graph scene remain inactive;
  the active City media \`figure\` retains its caption, and the live MapLibre
  \`canvas\` carries the direct City accessible name and sole selection marker
  without intercepting MapLibre gestures. No active or visible City-created
  Three.js/R3F presentation, HTML POI marker, generic selectable wrapper, or
  \`aria-hidden\` decoration competes with it; any retained shared canvas is
  inactive and pointer-transparent.
- [ ] Zone, one Tick, Stop fencing, Advice, and Save/read-back pass.
- [ ] Media, Animation, Motion Control, Game Mode, Flight Sim, and Camera show
  one shared revision and their contracted projections.
- [ ] Browser console remains free of runtime errors.
- [ ] Exit removes the City zoning source/layers, clears the City-selected
  regional presentation without mutating its companion facts, and restores
  prior regional, FloatingPanel, and Canvas state exactly once.
- [ ] A second neutral run produces byte-identical initial serialization and
  an equal regional feature/provenance digest.
- [ ] Protected integration completes for the verified candidate.

No box may be checked from source inspection alone. Protected integration,
production publication, and cloud release remain separate gates, and this
increment grants none of those release actions.
