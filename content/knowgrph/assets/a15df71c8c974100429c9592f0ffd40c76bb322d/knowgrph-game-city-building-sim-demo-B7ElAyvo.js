# Knowgrph City Simulation

This Source Files document is the derived local activation and proof projection
for a deterministic city simulation. Applying it requests \`cityBuilder\` and
Geo+XR Mode. The existing native MapLibre Geo host owns the geographic visual
renderer, camera, and viewport gestures. \`CitySimMediaFigure\` wraps that
geospatial projection directly as a labeled semantic City media stage; City
mounts zero Three.js/React Three Fiber Canvas, stage, mesh, camera, or pointer
handler. MapLibre parcel clicks and City Builder coordinate controls dispatch
to the same City Runtime selection owner.

The source parser initializes the City grid and geographic profile from this
document. \`kg-city-sim:geo-overlay\` projects all live parcels into the retained
map as zone fill, extrusion, outline, and selected-parcel layers; zoning,
economy ticks, and selection update that source from the same runtime revision.

City also uses \`projectCitySimAerialInspectionToGeospatialOverlay\` to derive one
deterministic route and one stopped aircraft from the typed \`city_geo_xr\`
profile authored in this document. The shared \`CanvasViewport\` geospatial
publisher sends that result with atomic presentation owner \`city\`, a null XR
environment, and free-orbit metadata through the existing Flight overlay store
and MapLibre source/layers. That presentation path cannot install the Flight
bootstrap style, camera, padding, gameplay, controls, mission, or readiness.
City creates no duplicate map, source/layer ids, Canvas, or renderer.

City never starts or retains the native XR physics playground. The Three
renderer excludes the authored/native graph for City source intent, and City
mounts no Three scene. One labeled semantic \`figure\` wraps the native MapLibre
Geo+XR host directly and exposes the existing media-selection marker only while
City is active. It has a \`figcaption\` and no pointer capture, and its wrapper
adds no generic \`div\` or \`aria-hidden\`, so selection tooling can find the stage
without stealing MapLibre gestures or City Builder parcel input.

The normative requirements live at
\`.kiro/specs/knowgrph-city-building-sim/requirements.md\`. This document does
not establish runtime readiness by declaration. Its status stays
\`proof-pending\` until focused tests and neutral browser evidence pass at the
exact candidate SHA.

## Authored initial parcel grid

The source parser must initialize the City Runtime from exactly this parcel
table and the \`city_initial\` metadata in frontmatter:

\`\`\`csv
parcel_id,row,column,zone,land_value_cents,population,pollution
r00c00,0,0,residential,10000,10,0
r00c01,0,1,commercial,9000,5,0
r00c02,0,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r00c03,0,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
r01c00,1,0,industrial,7000,0,2
r01c01,1,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
r01c02,1,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r01c03,1,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c00,2,0,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c01,2,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c02,2,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c03,2,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c00,3,0,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c01,3,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c02,3,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c03,3,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
\`\`\`

## Local use

1. Run the repository-owned development command.
2. Start from a browser with no city demo environment selector, persisted city
   state, URL selection, or previously open city runtime.
3. Confirm City Builder is closed, the City media figure is presentational and
   inactive, and Flight gameplay is inactive.
4. Open Explorer -> Source Files and wait for bootstrap readiness.
5. Open this document and apply it.
6. Confirm Geo+XR Mode shows the source-authored 4 by 4 parcel grid with its
   stopped aircraft and route overlay, then confirm City Builder opens with
   tick \`0\`, treasury \`100000\` cents, and population \`15\`.
7. Confirm the existing Flight Geo layers show this document's authored City
   route and stopped aircraft without opening Flight gameplay or
   readiness.

The simulation does not auto-start and does not auto-save.

## Core loop

Select \`r00c02\`, assign a zone, Start, observe one committed tick, then Stop.
The next tick uses the exact v1 coefficients in frontmatter. Stop must fence
queued ticks. Advice returns at most two local heuristic rounds and never
changes a parcel by itself.

Save writes only \`/game-city-sim/city-grid.md\`, reads that path back, compares
bytes and parsed state, and reports success only after both comparisons pass.
Malformed existing bytes remain untouched and block Start/Restart; Reset
restores this authored grid in memory without overwriting the path.

## FloatingPanel checks

All projections must report the same runtime revision:

- Media: palette and parcel appearance;
- Animation: fixed-step playback;
- Motion Control: normalized input and selected parcel;
- Game Mode: exclusive city-overlay state;
- Flight Sim: read-only City aerial handoff with no Flight gameplay or second
  city world;
- Camera: native MapLibre framing.

City Builder remains the complete editing surface. Exit restores the prior
FloatingPanel/Canvas surface state exactly once and neither captures nor
restores a Three camera.

## Validation status

- [ ] Focused economy, codec, Advisor, invocation, runtime, MCP, routing, and
  type checks pass at the exact candidate SHA.
- [ ] Neutral proof records City Builder closed and the City media figure
  presentational/inactive before applying this Source File.
- [ ] Source application alone selects Geo+XR, retains one native MapLibre host
  wrapped by \`CitySimMediaFigure\`, and loads the authored grid in City
  Builder.
- [ ] Sixteen live parcel features render through the City source/layers;
  MapLibre clicks and City Builder controls share parcel selection; one zone
  and selection mutation is visible; and zero City Three.js/R3F
  Canvas/stage/mesh/camera mounts.
- [ ] The independent existing Flight source/layers show the deterministic
  stopped aircraft/route without Flight bootstrap, camera, padding, gameplay,
  environment, readiness, or duplicate map/source/layer ids.
- [ ] The native XR physics playground and authored graph scene remain absent,
  the Flight XR environment source is empty, and the active City media \`figure\`
  is named and selectable without intercepting MapLibre gestures.
- [ ] Zone, one Tick, Stop fencing, Advice, and Save/read-back pass.
- [ ] Media, Animation, Motion Control, Game Mode, Flight Sim, and Camera show
  one shared revision and their contracted projections.
- [ ] Browser console remains free of runtime errors.
- [ ] Exit restores the prior FloatingPanel/Canvas surface state exactly once.
- [ ] A second neutral run produces byte-identical initial serialization.
- [ ] Protected integration completes for the verified candidate.

No box may be checked from source inspection alone. Protected integration,
production publication, and cloud release remain separate gates, and this
increment grants none of those release actions.
