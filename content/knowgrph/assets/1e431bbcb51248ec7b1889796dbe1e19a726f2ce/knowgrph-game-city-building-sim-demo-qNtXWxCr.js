# Knowgrph City Simulation

This Source Files document is the derived local activation and proof projection
for a deterministic city simulation. Applying it requests \`cityBuilder\` and
Geo+XR Mode. The existing native MapLibre Geo host owns the geographic visual
renderer, camera, and viewport gestures. \`SemanticMediaFigure\` wraps that
geospatial projection directly as a labeled semantic City media stage; City
creates and activates zero Three.js/React Three Fiber stage, mesh, camera, or
pointer owner. Any retained shared Canvas remains invisible, inactive, and
pointer-transparent. MapLibre parcel clicks and City Builder controls dispatch
to the same City Runtime selection owner.

The source parser initializes the City grid and geographic profile from this
document. \`kg-city-sim:geo-overlay\` projects all live parcels into the retained
map as zone fill, extrusion, outline, and selected-parcel layers; zoning,
economy ticks, and selection update that source from the same runtime revision.
The \`regional_poi_profile_id\` resolves one immutable geographic profile whose
locale facts remain solely in the selected companion. Its exact geographic
rings, real-metre heights, accuracy, and provenance project through nine
surface features plus three topology-aware representative identity locators in
\`kg-geo-xr:regional-poi\`. Its five MapLibre layers keep massing below City
parcels and make each POI visible through a fixed-pixel locator and
collision-aware variable-anchor label. City does not copy or mutate that
profile.

City also uses \`projectCitySimAerialInspectionToGeospatialOverlay\` to derive one
deterministic route and one stopped aircraft from the typed \`city_geo_xr\`
profile authored in this document. The shared \`CanvasViewport\` geospatial
publisher sends that result with atomic presentation owner \`city\` and
free-orbit metadata through the existing Flight overlay store and MapLibre
sources/layers. It does not project the selected Flight-local XR environment,
its local stage, derived XR POI presentation, source, or features into the City
presentation. That absence does not suppress the separate regional geographic
POI band. Geographic context remains owned by the real native MapLibre
basemap; source-authored City parcel dimensions and gaps are converted from
meters to geographic coordinates exactly once. Regional geographic POIs render
below the City parcel stack, and the stopped aircraft and route remain above
both. The native MapLibre camera frames the union of regional POI and parcel
bounds inside the visible aperture. That presentation path cannot install the
Flight bootstrap style, camera, padding, gameplay, controls, mission, or
readiness. City creates no duplicate map, source/layer ids, Canvas, renderer,
or parallel HTML POI marker layer.

City never starts the native XR physics playground. The Three renderer excludes
the authored/native graph for City source intent, and any retained shared
Canvas remains inactive, invisible, and pointer-transparent. One labeled
semantic \`figure\` wraps the native MapLibre
Geo+XR host directly. Its live MapLibre \`canvas\` carries the direct City
accessible name and the sole media-selection marker while City is active; the
figure keeps its \`figcaption\` but carries no competing selection marker. Neither
wrapper nor canvas adds \`aria-hidden\` or captures pointer input, so selection
tooling can identify the stage without stealing MapLibre gestures or City
Builder parcel input. No generic replacement wrapper or regional HTML marker
creates a competing selection target.

The normative requirements live at
\`.kiro/specs/knowgrph-city-building-sim/requirements.md\`. This document does
not establish runtime readiness by declaration. Its status stays
\`proof-pending\` until focused tests and neutral browser evidence pass at the
exact candidate SHA.

## Authored initial parcel grid

The source parser must initialize the City Runtime from exactly this parcel
table and the \`city_initial\` metadata in frontmatter:

\`\`\`csv
parcel_id,row,column,zone,land_value_cents,population,pollution
r00c00,0,0,residential,10000,10,0
r00c01,0,1,commercial,9000,5,0
r00c02,0,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r00c03,0,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
r01c00,1,0,industrial,7000,0,2
r01c01,1,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
r01c02,1,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r01c03,1,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c00,2,0,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c01,2,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c02,2,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c03,2,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c00,3,0,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c01,3,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c02,3,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c03,3,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
\`\`\`

## Local use

1. Run the repository-owned development command.
2. Start from a browser with the native MapLibre basemap, no persisted city
   state, no URL selection, and no previously open city runtime.
3. Confirm City Builder is closed, the City media figure is presentational and
   inactive, and Flight gameplay is inactive.
4. Open Explorer -> Source Files and wait for bootstrap readiness.
5. Open this document and apply it.
6. Confirm Geo+XR Mode shows nine companion-selected regional geographic POI
   surfaces at their exact rings and real-metre heights plus three visible
   fixed-pixel identity locators and labels, with the source-authored,
   meter-scaled 4 by 4 parcel grid above them and the stopped aircraft and route
   above both on the real native MapLibre basemap. Confirm no Flight-local XR
   environment source or features exist and the camera frames the regional
   features plus parcels. Then confirm City Builder opens with tick \`0\`,
   treasury \`100000\` cents, and population \`15\`.
7. Confirm the existing Flight Geo layers show this document's authored City
   route and stopped aircraft without opening Flight gameplay or
   readiness.

The simulation does not auto-start and does not auto-save.

## Core loop

Select \`r00c02\`, assign a zone, Start, observe one committed tick, then Stop.
The next tick uses the exact v1 coefficients in frontmatter. Stop must fence
queued ticks. Advice returns at most two local heuristic rounds and never
changes a parcel by itself.

Save writes only \`/game-city-sim/city-grid.md\`, reads that path back, compares
bytes and parsed state, and reports success only after both comparisons pass.
Malformed existing bytes remain untouched and block Start/Restart; Reset
restores this authored grid in memory without overwriting the path.

## FloatingPanel checks

All projections must report the same runtime revision:

- Media: palette and parcel appearance;
- Animation: fixed-step playback;
- Motion Control: normalized input and selected parcel;
- Game Mode: exclusive city-overlay state;
- Flight Sim: read-only City aerial handoff with no Flight gameplay or second
  city world;
- Camera: native MapLibre framing.

City Builder remains the complete editing surface. Exit restores the prior
FloatingPanel/Canvas surface state exactly once and neither captures nor
restores a Three camera.

## Validation status

- [ ] Focused economy, codec, Advisor, invocation, runtime, MCP, routing, and
  type checks pass at the exact candidate SHA.
- [ ] Neutral proof records City Builder closed and the City media figure
  presentational/inactive before applying this Source File, with no
  Flight-local XR environment source/layers, no
  \`kg-city-sim:geo-overlay\` source/layers, and no \`kg-geo-xr:regional-poi\`
  source/layers.
- [ ] Source application alone selects Geo+XR, retains one native MapLibre host
  wrapped by \`SemanticMediaFigure\`, and loads the authored grid in City
  Builder.
- [ ] Sixteen live parcel features render through the City source/layers;
  MapLibre clicks and City Builder controls share parcel selection; one zone
  and selection mutation is visible; and zero City-created, active, or visible
  Three.js/R3F stage/mesh/camera mounts. Any retained shared canvas is inactive
  and pointer-transparent.
- [ ] The real native MapLibre basemap remains the only geographic renderer.
  The companion-selected regional geographic POI collection preserves its
  nine exact rings, real-metre heights, accuracy, and provenance below City
  parcels, plus three visible identity locators and labels; the MapLibre camera
  frames the POIs plus parcel bounds. No selected
  Flight-local XR environment source or features exist in the City
  presentation. Source-authored City parcels project their meter dimensions
  and gaps once, and the independent existing Flight source/layers show the
  deterministic stopped aircraft/route above both lower bands without Flight
  bootstrap, camera, padding, gameplay, readiness, or duplicate
  map/source/layer ids.
- [ ] The native XR physics playground and authored graph scene remain inactive;
  the active City media \`figure\` retains its caption, and the live MapLibre
  \`canvas\` carries the direct City accessible name and sole selection marker
  without intercepting MapLibre gestures. No active or visible City-created
  Three.js/R3F presentation, HTML POI marker, generic selectable wrapper, or
  \`aria-hidden\` decoration competes with it; any retained shared canvas is
  inactive and pointer-transparent.
- [ ] Zone, one Tick, Stop fencing, Advice, and Save/read-back pass.
- [ ] Media, Animation, Motion Control, Game Mode, Flight Sim, and Camera show
  one shared revision and their contracted projections.
- [ ] Browser console remains free of runtime errors.
- [ ] Exit removes the City parcel source/layers, clears the City-selected
  regional presentation without mutating its companion facts, and restores
  prior regional, FloatingPanel, and Canvas state exactly once.
- [ ] A second neutral run produces byte-identical initial serialization and
  equal regional feature/provenance and aerial-projection digests.
- [ ] Protected integration completes for the verified candidate.

No box may be checked from source inspection alone. Protected integration,
production publication, and cloud release remain separate gates, and this
increment grants none of those release actions.
