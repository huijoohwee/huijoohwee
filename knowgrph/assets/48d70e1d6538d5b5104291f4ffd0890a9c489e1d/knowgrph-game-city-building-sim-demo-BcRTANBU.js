# Knowgrph City Simulation

This Source Files document is the derived local activation and proof projection
for a deterministic city simulation. Applying it requests \`cityBuilder\` and a
City Stage inside the existing shared XR Canvas. The stage is an additive
gameplay overlay; \`isometric-topdown\` is its orthographic camera framing, not a
Canvas mode and not a separate world.

The normative requirements live at
\`.kiro/specs/knowgrph-city-building-sim/requirements.md\`. This document does
not establish runtime readiness by declaration. Its status stays
\`proof-pending\` until focused tests and neutral browser evidence pass at the
exact candidate SHA.

## Authored default parcel fixture

The runtime default factory and codec test must serialize exactly this parcel
table under the KGC header described in frontmatter:

\`\`\`csv
parcel_id,row,column,zone,land_value_cents,population,pollution
r00c00,0,0,residential,10000,10,0
r00c01,0,1,commercial,9000,5,0
r00c02,0,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r00c03,0,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
r01c00,1,0,industrial,7000,0,2
r01c01,1,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
r01c02,1,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r01c03,1,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c00,2,0,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c01,2,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c02,2,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r02c03,2,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c00,3,0,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c01,3,1,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c02,3,2,unzoned,5000,0,0
r03c03,3,3,unzoned,5000,0,0
\`\`\`

## Local use

1. Run the repository-owned development command.
2. Start from a browser with no city demo environment selector, persisted city
   state, URL selection, or previously open city runtime.
3. Confirm City Builder is closed and the City Stage inactive.
4. Open Explorer -> Source Files and wait for bootstrap readiness.
5. Open this document and apply it.
6. Confirm City Builder opens with tick \`0\`, treasury \`100000\` cents,
   population \`15\`, and the 4 by 4 fixture.

The simulation does not auto-start and does not auto-save.

## Core loop

Select \`r00c02\`, assign a zone, Start, observe one committed tick, then Stop.
The next tick uses the exact v1 coefficients in frontmatter. Stop must fence
queued ticks. Advice returns at most two local heuristic rounds and never
changes a parcel by itself.

Save writes only \`/game-city-sim/city-grid.md\`, reads that path back, compares
bytes and parsed state, and reports success only after both comparisons pass.
Malformed existing bytes remain untouched and block Start/Restart; Reset
selects this authored fixture in memory without overwriting the path.

## FloatingPanel checks

All projections must report the same runtime revision:

- Media: palette and parcel appearance;
- Animation: fixed-step playback;
- Motion Control: normalized input and selected parcel;
- Game Mode: exclusive city-overlay state;
- Flight Sim: read-only aerial handoff with no second city world;
- Camera: orthographic framing and captured restore target.

City Builder remains the complete editing surface. Exit restores the prior
FloatingPanel surface and camera exactly once.

## Validation status

- [ ] Focused economy, codec, Advisor, invocation, runtime, MCP, routing, and
  type checks pass at the exact candidate SHA.
- [ ] Neutral proof records City Builder closed and City Stage inactive before
  applying this Source File.
- [ ] Source application alone opens \`cityBuilder\` and materializes the authored
  fixture on one Canvas.
- [ ] Zone, one Tick, Stop fencing, Advice, and Save/read-back pass.
- [ ] Media, Animation, Motion Control, Game Mode, Flight Sim, and Camera show
  one shared revision and their contracted projections.
- [ ] Browser console remains free of runtime errors.
- [ ] Exit restores the prior surface and camera exactly once.
- [ ] A second neutral run produces byte-identical initial serialization.
- [ ] Protected integration completes for the verified candidate.

No box may be checked from source inspection alone. Protected integration,
production publication, and cloud release remain separate gates, and this
increment grants none of those release actions.
