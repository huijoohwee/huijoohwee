# AR/VR/XR Runtime-readiness Demo

This Source Files document is the dedicated workspace demo for the immutable v3.0.0 AR/VR/XR authority. It stays source-backed, local-first, and bounded to AC-1 through AC-12 browser proof while AC-14 remains source-only.

The pinned authority's source identity is commit
\`1272bae345edf0d132e6fc750d5c5c7eade00b29\`; its path and content digests are recorded in \`pinned_source\` above.

## Run the browser demo

Run \`npm run dev\`, then apply **Explorer → Source Files → docs → workspace-seeds → agentic-graph-ar-vr-xr-runtime-readiness-demo.md**. The applied document mounts the shared world as a \`full-frame-playground\` and keeps the same canonical XR owner through the existing runtime adapters. Use \`npm run xr-v2:review-ready\` for the exact local proof gate.

## Camera and sensor control

Camera and sensor access stay user-owned and disabled by default. The user can enable or stop capture at any time; denial fails closed to the non-capture viewer. Camera source selection remains \`fixed-follow\` or \`free-orbit\` through \`/camera.select @camera #camera\` and \`agentic-graph.control_local_camera\`.

## Solopreneur MVP loop

This seed is the lean rehearsal loop for Dev and Home Apex: author once, rehearse locally, and keep release, publish, storage, and commerce as explicit later steps. The same source owns Timeline, Animation, Motion Control, Camera, and Game Mode overlay boundaries.

## Physics Playground

This story uses the native Tropical Playground island, ocean, palms and dock with source-authored selectable subjects. The catalog-driven stable terrain IDs also retain the procedural Singapore waterfront terrain and Marina Bay towers as selectable alternatives. The asset defaults remain \`vehicle-helicopter\`, \`vehicle-sedan\`, and \`prop-ball\`. Placed subjects remain visible while the controller demo runs.

The objective loop is simple: \`collect key then unlock treasure\`. The ball keeps \`rolling movement\`, \`grounded jump\`, air steering, and modifier torque. The rocket keeps \`directional thrust\`, bounded tilt, and \`modifier stabilization\`, plus the bounded aerial composition. Standard gamepad movement remains \`standard left stick\`.

MCP control stays source-backed through \`/xr.physics @canvas #controller operation=develop-run mode=ball\` and \`agentic-graph.control_local_xr_scene\`. Motion Control remains optional and local through \`/motion.control @canvas #pose operation=start backend=auto\`, \`agentic-graph.inspect_local_motion_control\`, and \`agentic-graph.control_local_motion_control\`.

Game Mode remains an overlay, not a second world. It opens with \`/game.mode @canvas #gameplay operation=open\`, is inspectable through \`agentic-graph.inspect_local_game_mode\`, controllable through \`agentic-graph.control_local_game_mode\`, and must temporarily suspend the native XR controller stage and restore it on exit.

## Timeline and choreography asides

BottomPanel Timeline owns mark timing, easing, gait, position and selection. FloatingPanel Animation owns path and character-motion presets and shows the shared mark summary. The playable rehearsal slice stays under one minute and is stepped through the existing transport, cue selection, and mark inspection owners.

### Playable script

**{{rehearsal_title}}**

Scene: {{kgXrMotionReference.stageId}} · Duration: {{kgXrMotionReference.durationSeconds}} seconds · {{kgXrMotionReference.fps}} fps.

{{kgXrMotionReference.camera.0.caption}}

{{kgXrMotionReference.camera.1.caption}}

{{kgXrMotionReference.camera.2.caption}} {{kgXrMotionReference.camera.3.caption}}

{{kgXrMotionReference.camera.4.caption}}

{{kgXrMotionReference.camera.5.caption}}

{{kgXrMotionReference.camera.6.caption}}

Open an inline asset chip to use the existing searchable Variable commands menu. Scene choices invoke \`/xr.stage @stage\`; subject and prop choices invoke \`/xr.transform @subject #transform asset=asset\`. The native catalog and the same \`control_local_xr_scene\` controller used by MCP and WebMCP own validation and frontmatter persistence. Authored role labels and stable subject IDs stay intact; asset words resolve from the catalog. Nested caption references keep this body unchanged. Animation owns path and character-motion presets. Timeline owns static transforms, mark easing, gait, position, timing, playback, speed, seek and frame-step. Motion Control uses the same selected target and mark; Camera keeps the same anchors; Game Mode suspends and restores the shared world.

Media → Subjects & Props now switches between **In scene** and **Add from library** under one category/search filter. Story performers, houses, sailboat, soup pot and Tropical Playground use native visual illustrations. No camera/microphone, network asset or paid service is required.

## Source Files storage and refresh

This Git-backed file is the canonical seed. Restart the dev server after source changes, reload, and use **Source Files → Refresh**. Local save, workspace sync, and Git commit remain distinct outcomes.

## Scoped XR edited-media evidence

This document projects downstream evidence for \`xr-authoring-edited-media-delivery\`; applying it starts the native Playground and readiness controls. It does not load a video sequence, run the dedicated smoke route, or claim that opening the XR choreography Timeline reproduces the edited-media proof.

The checked-in snapshot remains \`source-ready\`, while the protected delivery chain for this scope is \`runtime-ready\`. The evidence covers canonical Timeline routing, same-origin browser-native edited-media export, non-empty output, decoded metadata, bounded playback, and teardown. It does not claim mounted-renderer material wiring, live depth quality, physical-device lifecycle proof, Production availability, or deployment authority.

## Validation

Run \`npm run xr-v2:review-ready\` on the clean candidate for source, runtime, and browser evidence. Physical-device and Production boundaries remain explicit.
`;export{e as default};
