# Native Flight Sim in Geo+XR Mode

This Source Files document is the local Geo+XR Mode runtime authority for one deterministic, browser-local flight mission. Applying it opens **Flight Sim**, keeps the selected native MapLibre view visible, and projects the route, conditional aircraft-to-active-objective course segment, waypoints, and aircraft through dedicated map layers before preparing a healthy mission at tick zero and waiting for normalized input. The course segment shares one pure route-guidance state with exclusive plain Geo, the north-up inset, and the mobile/desktop HUD, and disappears after mission completion. The existing R3F Canvas remains mounted only for simulation/input/readiness and paints no Flight or XR world geometry. Geo view selection changes the actual MapLibre 2D/3D Classic/Modern presentation. It does not create another R3F Canvas, terrain, collider catalog, Flight-owned map provider/camera, persistence owner, external dependency, or deployment surface.

## Run locally

From the repository root, run \`npm run dev\`. In agentic-graph, open **Explorer → Source Files → docs → workspace-seeds → agentic-graph-game-flight-sim-demo.md** and apply the document. The source-authored \`run_ready_demo.id: flight-sim\` activates XR/3D and the Flight Sim panel; an imported path is not required, and a conflicting known path fails closed.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Touch | Standard gamepad |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pitch / roll | W/A/S/D or arrow keys | Discrete Pitch/Roll buttons | Left stick |
| Yaw | Q / E | Discrete Yaw buttons | Shoulder buttons |
| Throttle up / down | Shift / Control | Throttle slider | Triggers |
| Camera view | C cycles Chase / Cockpit / Survey | HUD or FloatingPanel camera buttons | HUD or FloatingPanel camera buttons |
| Pause / Resume / Reset | HUD or FloatingPanel controls | HUD or FloatingPanel controls | HUD or FloatingPanel controls |

The browser-local control contract uses \`agentic-graph.control_local_flight_sim\` and strict \`/flight.sim @canvas #flight\`, with schema \`agentic-graph-flight-sim-mcp/v1\`. Throttle is explicit: \`/flight.sim @canvas #flight operation=throttle throttle=0.75\`. Duplicate sigils, unknown keys, mixed native/structured input, missing tokens, and invalid lifecycle operations fail closed with a named diagnostic and offending token or field. Inspect and control return deterministic timeout, unavailable, execution, or validation envelopes within a hard 2,000 ms deadline.

**FloatingPanel → Flight Sim** controls Open, Start, Stop, Restart, Throttle, Save, and Exit. The panel projects runtime state only; in Geo+XR, native MapLibre owns visible aircraft/route geometry and the retained R3F mission stage is visual-free.

Camera source is independent of aircraft selection. In **FloatingPanel Camera → SHOOT**, choose the catalog's only two modes: **Fixed Follow** for aircraft-relative MapLibre framing or **Free Orbit** for direct map pan and zoom. While Fixed Follow is active, the Flight panel, HUD, or \`C\` key selects **Chase**, **Cockpit**, or **Survey**; the Geo host applies the corresponding visible MapLibre center, bearing, pitch, and zoom. Cockpit uses the canonical collision-clear eye to derive its forward look-ahead map center. Flight never mounts a map or camera. Timeline camera-mark playback temporarily maps the sampled authored pose into visible MapLibre center, bearing, pitch, and zoom, then returns to the selected source.

The north-up local navigation inset projects the authored mission spawn, ordered waypoint rings, landing pad, aircraft position, heading, objective distance, bearing, signed heading error, and the same aircraft-to-objective course segment used by MapLibre and exclusive plain Geo. A compact HUD cue names the objective and reports rounded distance plus \`HOLD COURSE\` or deterministic left/right turn correction; only objective transitions use the polite live region. It is deterministic SVG/DOM over the existing HUD and panel: no map tiles, geocoder, token, network request, alternate terrain, or external runtime dependency. Motion Control is optional normalized player input only and never becomes flight policy. Conflicting device commands resolve independently per axis to the value with the largest absolute magnitude.

For pose control, open and start **Motion Control** from the active Flight panel, then use **Flight Sim** in the training card to return to the aircraft. The mission and camera capture remain live across that panel handoff. Lean forward/back for pitch, lean side-to-side for roll, raise both hands for power, and hold hands wide while leaning to yaw; the Flight panel reports whether capture is connected and whether a full-body pose is currently driving the aircraft.

Terminal results remain pending and never auto-save. **Save** is the only operation that persists validated gameplay Decisions through browser-local WorkspaceFs at \`/game-flight-sim/mission-1-decisions.md\`; explicit **Reset local save** is a separate recovery write of the canonical empty AGENTIC_OS document. Successful hydration preserves the validated active run identifier and ordered waypoint history, Start continues that run, and only Restart mints a fresh run. Malformed bytes remain intact and block Start and Restart until Reset succeeds.

The mission uses the fixed \`flight-meters-20\` transform: one authored scene unit equals 20 mission meters. Its geographic anchor is the community-reported WSSS airport location. The selected shared XR stage still supplies local practice collision geometry and route; neither is an observed airport procedure or surveyed runway. Native MapLibre separately presents the authored airport/traffic context. The simulation advances at exactly \`1/60\` second (approximately 16.667 ms, 60 Hz) and executes at most five catch-up ticks per advance. Capture three practice waypoints in authored order and then the simulated landing objective; all four radii are 50 m, and an out-of-order waypoint cannot advance progress.

Four meaningful systems run in stable transactional order: \`InputIntegrationSystem\`, \`FlightModelSystem\`, \`CollisionResolverSystem\`, and \`ObjectiveSystem\`. The Agentic ECS harness emits the one post-systems Cost_Log, and immutable render/HUD projection is captured only after the World commits. A failing system rolls back itself while retaining prior same-tick commits. Replay validates source, mission seed, input count/order/bytes, halts on the first divergence, and retains the last byte-equivalent committed World. Exit disposes the ECS World and unsaved in-memory mission state, restores the complete pre-document surface including Geo ownership, and does not acknowledge a prior non-Geo surface until MapLibre has released its active map and canvas for two committed frames.

## Evidence rehearsal: instrument uncertainty and local debrief

### WSSS airport and observed traffic context

The \`source_geospatial\` declaration selects the local scene through the existing MapLibre owner.
Its scene file owns field roles, colours, replay time and gap/staleness thresholds. Runtime code
contains no airport coordinates or aircraft catalog. Source-authored context keeps recorded traffic
active while Timeline and FloatingPanel open or close; practice aircraft, route, HUD and controls do
not replace it. The existing MapLibre camera frames accepted geometry once; UTC playback preserves
subsequent pan/zoom. Select labelled position buttons or path/runway outlines to inspect observation
UTC, status, altitude reference and source provenance. Tab then Enter/Space works on the same targets.
Use **Toolbar → Canvas View Mode → Display Controls → Timeline** for the shared transport. Its single rate button cycles from 0.25× through 20×; 20× wraps to 0.25×. An explicitly
authored simulation-only document without \`source_geospatial\` can use the practice exercises below.

- **Airport:** three pinned OurAirports runway records, Public Domain, source commit
  \`07f86e80d3f15296c3ff971f49c33ddb331c8d8a\`. The local source envelope preserves the exact CSV
  subset (\`a1747c5790f9ce98923f725c5a4401f960093ae8a0ce2881891451343362e416\`), original fields and references.
  Centreline joins and width-derived footprints are derived display geometry, not surveyed polygons.
  Runway 02R/20L retains source \`closed=1\`; all current operational statuses remain unverified.
- **Observed traffic:** three independent ADSB.lol aircraft, 85 position/altitude pairs and 15 explicit
  unknowns in 185 facts. The 4 October 2026 common observed span is 02:24:46.425–02:26:26.565 UTC;
  the initial cursor is 02:25:30 UTC. Gaps over 15 s break paths; samples older than 30 s are stale.
  Original source bytes and millisecond timestamps remain inspectable. Pressure altitude is retained
  without MSL/AGL conversion; proximity establishes no arrival, departure, runway use or clearance.
- **Airspace:** qualification remains unavailable. The source envelope links dated CAAS references
  and their rights limitation, without copying official geometry. Bounds, footprints and observed
  tracks are not controlled-airspace volumes. Synthetic volume exercises stay separately labelled.
- **Local assets:** the same verified offline manifest binds scene, provenance, corpus and licence
  bytes. Loading the scene requires no upstream data API; native basemap transport retains its own owner.

### Native evidence workspace

Open **Flight Sim → Evidence and analysis** in this same native panel. The declaration above selects
the profiles, policies and bundled examples; exact enabled, parsed SourceFile text owns activation.
The evidence modules load on opening the disclosure. Imported observations and authored synthetic
exercises remain independent of the simulation; gameplay never supplies observational truth.

- **Record / replay:** load the three-aircraft WSSS corpus, the earlier Singapore–Riau segment or permitted JSON/pack;
  inspect explicit UTC, unknowns, conflicts and gaps. Open a fact's source to inspect unchanged source
  text, rights, hash and its resolved original record. Save/reimport a pack to verify both identities.
- **Volumes:** project the synthetic compatible-datum polygon; inspect numeric floor/ceiling,
  validity and original vertices independently of its schematic SVG. The scene is not official airspace.
- **Arrival evaluation:** load the three synthetic chronological batches. Training correction,
  separate calibration and held-out metrics remain inspectable; synthetic truth cannot qualify the
  200-arrival independent real-data acceptance gate.
- **Route comparison:** compare explicit paired polylines using the declared fixed-sphere model and
  conditional positional bounds. This establishes no fuel, optimality or legal-feasibility claim.
- **Notice triage:** inspect the bounded explicit structured JSON exercise. Free text, compound
  geometry, recurring schedules and missing/incompatible datums remain unresolved. It is not an
  actual NOTAM or an assertion of 100-notice independent-label acceptance.

All controls use the native shared read-only executor and its displayed \`/operation @evidence #evidence\`
invocation. Source changes invalidate pending work; failed inputs retain the prior accepted result.
Record, volume and route exports are evidence packs. Arrival/notice exports are reports that must be
kept with their original inputs. Save completion, exact-head native browser/offline proof and real
acceptance gates require their own receipts. Physical iPhone Safari remains SKIP/KIV by user decision.
This is the sole product implementation and authored demo; no external product shell or host is used.

### Simulation-only reliability exercise

Use the existing night mission to practise judging the reliability of a displayed fact. This is a
synthetic, browser-local training scenario. Aircraft state, route, night palette, failure and coaching
come from the authored simulation; this exercise imports no observed flight, weather, schedule,
airspace restriction or arrival prediction.

1. Apply this source and inspect the active mission with
   \`agentic-graph.inspect_local_flight_sim\`. If its phase is \`ready\` or \`flying\`, issue
   \`/flight.sim @canvas #flight operation=stop\`; an already-stopped mission needs no Stop.
2. While stopped, select \`/flight.sim @canvas #flight operation=mission missionId=night-circuit\`, then
   \`/flight.sim @canvas #flight operation=failure failureId=instrument-uncertainty\`. Mission and failure selection are
   rejected while \`ready\` or \`flying\`; unsupported commands produce an explicit diagnostic.
3. Issue \`/flight.sim @canvas #flight operation=restart\` for a fresh mission at tick zero. Restart
   returns \`ready\`; do not issue Start immediately afterward, because Start resumes a \`stopped\`
   mission. Advance with the existing touch, keyboard or throttle controls.
4. Inspect \`flightSim.runId\`, \`flightSim.phase\` and \`flightSim.tick\` alongside
   \`training.missionId\`, \`training.failureId\`, \`training.failureActive\`,
   \`training.airspeedReliable\`, \`training.envelope\` and \`training.coachingCue\`.
   Instrument uncertainty is active from tick **180 inclusive to 420 exclusive**. Compare the
   reliability/coaching labels before, during and after that interval; this drill changes the
   deterministic reliability classification, not the provenance of the underlying simulation.
5. Use the north-up inset and Chase/Cockpit/Survey views to relate route progress, attitude and
   energy to the coaching cue. Stop pauses the current mission; Start resumes that same in-memory
   tick/state. Restart creates a fresh run, so keep its observations separate.
6. After a \`completed\` or \`crashed\` result, explicitly choose
   \`/flight.sim @canvas #flight operation=save\`. Inspect \`decisions.path\` and reopen
   \`/game-flight-sim/mission-1-decisions.md\` to read the local training outcome. Save is
   terminal-only and never automatic; unsaved progress is discarded on Exit.

| Observation | Source and interpretation |
|---|---|
| Position, velocity, ordered route and tick | Authored local simulation; not aircraft surveillance |
| Night palette and instrument-uncertainty window | Selected deterministic training configuration |
| Reliability label, envelope and coaching cue | Advisory game projections; inspect together rather than treating one number as truth |
| Score, grade and saved debrief | Explicit terminal training Decision in local WorkspaceFs |
| Actual flight, weather, schedule, restriction and ETA evidence | Not supplied by this rehearsal |

The saved outcome records mission, failure, score, grade and route/stability/energy results. It does
not contain an observed-flight source digest, signed provenance or hash chain. Code-level deterministic
replay belongs to \`flightSimReplay.ts\` and its existing tests; the current UI/control grammar exposes
no replay-trace export, arbitrary time-step, provenance or real-data import operation. This walkthrough
adds no runtime operation or second renderer. Flight simulation remains local; the selected Geo
provider's independent map transport and cached-asset availability determine basemap access.

### Shared display and pacing controls

Use **HUD overlays** to show or hide optional instruments and the course cue. **Navigation** independently shows or hides the existing north-up inset. The HUD and FloatingPanel immediately share the selected values; objective, errors, envelope warnings, camera, touch, and lifecycle controls remain available. Existing responsive inset behavior is preserved.

Choose **Simulation speed** \`0.5×\`, \`1×\`, or \`2×\` to pace the rehearsal. Each physics tick still advances exactly \`1 / 60\` second; slower pacing gives more time to observe the same authored tick-window, and faster pacing reaches it sooner. Compare captures by equal tick counts and identical normalized inputs, rather than equal wall time. Display/rate settings are ephemeral and are not saved with Decisions.

The presentation controls do not select a mission, location, failure, route, or source. The rehearsal above and the existing authored mission/scenario owners supply those details. Settings apply to any selected scenario through the same controls and clock. Training selection uses generic admitted-ID operations; this profile alone declares its compatibility aliases. No replay/export tool is introduced.

## Runtime-readiness gates

The new airport/traffic scene binding still requires exact-source browser and offline receipts; the gates below describe the existing native runtime contract and do not grant those new results.

- [x] Source identity is \`flight-sim\`, independent of import path, with conflict rejection.
- [x] Flight is a Geo+XR Mode composition: native MapLibre is the geospatial world and visible Flight renderer in all four views, one transparent R3F Canvas retains simulation/input/readiness with zero visuals, and duplicate XR terrain stays unmounted.
- [x] Fixed Follow and Free Orbit come from the shared Camera catalog; Fixed Follow drives visible MapLibre Chase/Cockpit/Survey framing and Free Orbit yields MapLibre pan/zoom.
- [x] Chase, Cockpit, and Survey vary only Flight's pure framing descriptor; Cockpit projects a collision-clear forward look-ahead and the north-up route inset derives entirely from authored local mission state with zero map or token dependency.
- [x] The default load is spec-primary for the required aircraft and contains exactly one committed-local optional opaque GLB; remote and unavailable fallbacks fail closed.
- [x] Exactly 40 named fast-check properties are registered for at least 100 cases each (4,000 generated cases), alongside focused source checks.
- [x] Browser proof enforces a clean exact branch/HEAD/tree and authored-seed SHA-256 before each of two fresh serial runs, including visible MapLibre plus Flight overlay, ≤3 s first-frame, 375×812 HUD, lifecycle, camera, persistence-failure, pointer-lock contract, and provider-attributed transport.
- [x] Runtime and browser verification execute in child-owned exact local workspaces; failed tracked/untracked mutations are discarded, cleanup precedes browser evidence publication, and publication failure restores prior evidence bytes.
- [x] \`npm run game-flight-sim:runtime-ready\` is the mandatory aggregate gate for the clean final candidate.
- [x] \`npm run game-flight-sim:browser-smoke\` requires two serial runs on that same exact candidate revision.
- [ ] The protected PR integrates the verified candidate.

The unchecked protected-integration gate is release state, not missing runtime behavior. Every handoff must re-run the exact-head source and browser proof. This scope authorizes no Agentic workspace-seed projection, Prod/Cloudflare deployment, or public release.
