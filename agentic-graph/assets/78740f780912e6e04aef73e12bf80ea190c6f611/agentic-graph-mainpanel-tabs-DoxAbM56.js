Skills & Commands now lives in the FloatingPanel header as the button immediately beside Props Panel, so slash-invokable skills stay close to widget and node authoring actions without occupying a MainPanel tab or coupling to Props Panel layout.

Design editing likewise lives in FloatingPanel Design. The former MainPanel Design entry is
retired; MainPanel Settings remains the shared appearance control surface.

Preview Panel lives in FloatingPanel. It reuses the Media catalog layout and selection controls, with selected media/diagram preview and collapsible Document insights. Existing \`kg:mainPanelOpen\` requests for \`preview\` redirect to FloatingPanel. Signal badges open source-linked insights there.
