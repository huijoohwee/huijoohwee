  core_offer: "a Codex-anchored SuperAgent harness that plans, generates, verifies, recovers, and renders rich media work on a Knowgrph Canvas"
  source_fixture: "huijoohwee/docs/knowgrph-video-demo.md"
  destination_fixture: "huijoohwee/docs/knowgrph-ralphthon-video-demo.md"
  inspiration_boundary: "Inspired by public long-horizon SuperAgent harness patterns such as multi-agent planning, tool use, memory, sandboxing, and verifier loops; no code, prompts, topology, assets, or implementation details are copied from DeerFlow."
  setting: "A three-country media mission moving from Singapore harbor lights to South Korea robotics neon to a US launch coastline, led by an OpenClaw lobster signal mark."
  script: |
    Cold open: A clean 16:9 Knowgrph Canvas appears. MainPanel Integrations confirms Codex is connected. The FloatingPanel Chat UI receives a goal: generate a polished rich media sequence for Ralphthon.

    Beat 1 - Singapore: OpenClaw wakes on a midnight control table overlooking Marina Bay. A red lobster signal mark is projected as a routing glyph, not a mascot costume. The planner splits the job into text, image, video, and verification lanes.

    Beat 2 - South Korea: The canvas crossfades to a Seoul robotics lab with Busan port telemetry on the side wall. Sub-agents negotiate constraints: Korean neon palette, Singapore harbor precision, US launch energy, no copied reference implementation, no hardcoded repo fixture.

    Beat 3 - US: The system lands on a coastal launch deck. The video generator receives the verified image keyframe and the final shot plan. The verifier rejects one weak attempt, recovers from the trace, and reruns only the failed lane.

    Finale: The Rich Media Panel shows text, image, and video outputs at once. Edges remain visible, ports are named, and the judge can read why the harness stopped: all acceptance checks passed, artifacts exist, and the final canvas is balanced.

    End card: "OpenClaw for Ralphthon - tame the agent, operate the loop, ship the media."
  visual_style: |
    Cinematic but technical. Use crisp UI surfaces, visible graph edges, and credible production controls. Color story: signal red, steel blue, harbor cyan, lab green, and warm launch white. Avoid a one-note palette. Treat the lobster as an emblem and motion cue, not comic relief.

    - "Agent roles are narrow enough to inspect and broad enough to finish without babysitting."
    - "Every media artifact has a named producer, verifier, memory entry, and canvas target."
    - "The final canvas must explain the run through edges, ports, traces, and output panels."

# Ralphthon Video Demo - OpenClaw SuperAgent Harness

## Typed Fixture Contract

- The opening YAML frontmatter block remains the first-block machine SSOT for renderer activation, harness metadata, pipeline inputs, and graph-backed runtime state.
- This document is an approved typed validation fixture, not a canonical plain-YAML-only authoring example.
- Normalized `{key, type, value}` envelopes in `flow.nodes[*]`, `flow.edges[*]`, and related graph-bearing frontmatter are intentional here so ingest -> parse -> render validates typed harness payload handling directly.
- Surrounding frontmatter such as `inputs`, `spec`, `superagent_harness`, `widget_bundle`, `canvas`, `runner`, and `pipeline` stays canonical YAML so the fixture still demonstrates normal frontmatter authoring around the typed graph payload.
- Canonical authored harness docs should still prefer plain YAML for frontmatter and related schema-bearing blocks outside dedicated validation fixtures.
- Runtime behavior must still be derived from parsed frontmatter and document content only, never from file path assumptions or hardcoded demo fallbacks.

This demo shows Knowgrph operating a Codex-anchored SuperAgent harness for rich media generation on Canvas. The point is not just that the canvas can produce text, image, and video. The point is that the harness can run a long job, inspect itself, recover lane-by-lane, and stop for a legible reason.

The visual theme is OpenClaw: a precise red lobster signal mark moving across Singapore, South Korea, and the US. The mark is a routing emblem for the harness. It is used to make orchestration visible without turning the demo into a mascot reel.

## Demo Promise

OpenClaw receives one Ralphthon goal through the FloatingPanel Chat UI. It decomposes the job into text, image, video, and verifier lanes; generates the assets; binds them into the Rich Media Panel; and terminates only when the panel, edges, ports, and artifacts pass verification.

The judge should be able to read the canvas and answer:

- What was the goal?
- Which agents owned which lanes?
- What tools were used?
- What memory was retained?
- What checks passed?
- What happened if a lane failed?
- Why did the run stop?

## Voiceover

Ralphthon starts with a single instruction: make OpenClaw prove it can operate rich media end to end.

Codex receives the goal, but Codex is not left alone in a blank loop. OpenClaw wraps it with a harness: a lead agent, a planner, text, image, video, and a judge. Each lane has a job. Each output has a port. Each retry has a budget.

The first scene opens in Singapore. The canvas is calm, bright, and operational. A red lobster signal crosses Marina Bay, not as decoration, but as the trace of an agent route.

The second scene moves to South Korea. A robotics lab in Seoul watches Busan port telemetry stream across the wall. The planner turns the goal into a shot list. The text agent writes narration and prompts. The image agent creates the keyframe. The video agent waits for a verified reference.

The third scene lands in the US on a coastal launch deck. The video lane runs. The judge catches a weak edge binding, patches only the failed lane, and reruns verification. No babysitting. No silent partial success.

The final frame is the Knowgrph Canvas itself: MainPanel Integrations, FloatingPanel Chat UI, Editor Workspace, generation widgets, Rich Media Panel, and labeled edges. OpenClaw stops because the goal is complete and the harness can prove it.

## On-screen Canvas Actions

1. Open MainPanel Integrations and confirm Codex, text generation, image generation, video generation, and storage capability status.
2. Send the Ralphthon goal from FloatingPanel Chat UI.
3. Watch `w-goal-brief` produce the mission packet.
4. Watch `w-text-script` produce narration, image prompt, video prompt, and harness notes.
5. Watch `w-image-keyframe` bind `imageUrl`.
6. Watch `w-video-clip` consume `imageUrl` as `reference_image` and bind `videoUrl`.
7. Watch `w-harness-judge` check schema, artifacts, ports, copy policy, and 16:9 layout.
8. Watch `p-rich-media` render text, image, video, and judge report without hiding graph edges.

## Image Prompt

Create a 16:9 cinematic keyframe of an operational Knowgrph Canvas command room. The left pane shows Singapore Marina Bay harbor lights; the center pane shows a South Korea robotics lab with Seoul neon and Busan port telemetry; the right pane shows a US coastal launch deck. An OpenClaw interface overlays the scene. A precise red lobster signal glyph moves along visible graph edges from Text Widget to Image Widget to Video Widget to Rich Media Panel. The UI is crisp and readable, with no copied third-party interface, no cartoon mascot, no clutter, and a balanced 1920x1080 composition.

## Video Prompt

Create a 12-second 16:9 product-demo video. Start in the FloatingPanel Chat UI as a Ralphthon goal arrives. Pull back to show the Editor Workspace and Knowgrph Canvas. A red OpenClaw lobster signal routes through text, image, video, and judge widgets. The background moves through Singapore harbor, South Korea robotics neon, and a US coastal launch deck as synchronized panels on the canvas, not as separate travel footage. The verifier flags one issue, recovers the failed lane, and the Rich Media Panel resolves text, image, video, and judge report. End on a clean completion state with labeled edges and readable ports.

## Harness Notes

The harness uses a deliberate loop:

1. Goal is received and normalized.
2. Capability map is read from integrations.
3. Planner assigns agents and media lanes.
4. Text lane produces narration and prompts.
5. Image lane produces a keyframe.
6. Video lane produces motion from prompt and keyframe.
7. Canvas lane binds outputs to panel ports.
8. Judge verifies, recovers, or terminates.

Recovery is local to the failed lane. If video fails, text and image are not regenerated. If a panel port is missing, edges are patched and reparsed. If layout overlaps, node placement is rebalanced inside the 1920x1080 canvas.

Termination is explicit: complete only after schema parse, artifact presence, panel binding, copy policy, and live UI layout checks pass.

## Judge Checklist

- `$schema` is `kgc-pipeline/v1`.
- `widget_bundle.graph.nodes_ref` and `flow.nodes` agree.
- `widget_bundle.graph.edges_ref` and `flow.edges` agree.
- `p-rich-media` exists and has target ports for `output`, `imageUrl`, and `videoUrl`.
- The text output explains the harness, not only the media concept.
- The image and video prompts include OpenClaw, lobster signal, Singapore, South Korea, and US.
- The canvas remains balanced at 16:9 1920x1080.
- The validation fixture path is data for this demo, not a hardcoded dependency in the application.
- The DeerFlow reference is treated as category inspiration only; no code, phrasing, assets, or topology are copied.

## Completion Line

OpenClaw completes the Ralphthon run when the Rich Media Panel can display all generated media, the graph explains how the media was produced, and the harness records why it is safe to stop.
