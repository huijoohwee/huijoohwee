# Knowgrph Risk Copilot Demo

This is a `/prd-tad.create` minimum viable risk-copilot seed for SME growth-stage risk exposure and coverage-gap coaching. It uses `/source.normalize`, `/memory.seed`, `/harness.define`, `/cost.audit`, `/canvas.project`, `/runtime-ready.check`, `/validation.run`, and `/deploy.guard` with existing `#` semantic filters and `@` bindings. `/memory.seed #frontmatter #ttv #vcc @source.frontmatter @source.body`

The demo is intentionally neutral and local-first. It builds a Risk Exposure Graph (REG) from a redacted SME profile, fires growth-stage coverage triggers, proactively nudges the owner on graph deltas, and (only with operator approval) surfaces marketplace matches for a licensed broker to action. It does not underwrite, bind, quote, or claim live insurer/broker output. Runtime IDs, provider evidence, Prod mirror status, and Cloudflare deployment fields remain blank until real proof exists and the operator approves the relevant gate.

## Related Runtime Proof

The earlier deterministic `/sme-care-agent` runtime-proof document is preserved as [./knowgrph-sme-care-agent-runtime-proof.md](./knowgrph-sme-care-agent-runtime-proof.md). Keep this file as the risk-copilot demo contract and use the companion proof doc for the stricter three-domain SME care runtime evidence.

## Risk Copilot Flow

| Stage | Invocation | Output | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source | `/source.normalize #frontmatter #no-hardcode @source.frontmatter @source.body` | Redacted SME profile summary and missing-field list | Reject registry IDs, financials, and stale hardcodes |
| Ideation | `/memory.seed /prd-tad.create #ttv #vcc #foss @source.body @operator` | Minimum viable Risk Exposure Graph (REG) | Keep scope small and ROI-positive |
| Probe tree | `knowgrph.probe.generate` → `knowgrph.probe.select` → `knowgrph.probe.evolve` | Candidate growth-stage clarification questions, selected branch node, and gap-path memory exemplar | Markdown graph store stays SSOT; local model adapter is host-owned |
| Trigger engine | `/harness.define #harness @local-harness @mcp-gateway` | Growth-stage state machine firing coverage-review triggers | Fail before spend when schema or approval is missing |
| Broker copilot | `/harness.define #ttv @local-harness @operator` | Proactive plain-language nudge on new graph deltas | Nudge only; no autonomous purchase or bind action |
| Marketplace matcher | `/mcp.capabilities #approval-gate @mcp-gateway @operator` | Candidate coverage matches per gap, routed to licensed-broker handoff | Blocked until `@operator` approves `@approval-gate` |
| Cost | `/cost.audit #token-economics #tco @cost-log @operator` | Token, cache, TCO, and budget ledger | Local dry-run reports exact zero |
| Canvas | `/canvas.project #canvas @canvas @runtime-proof` | Storyboard cards and semantic Rich Media panel | Existing shared Canvas owners only |
| Validation | `/validation.run #vcc #runtime-ready @runtime-proof @dev-only` | Focused proof or spec-complete gap | No prose-only runtime-ready promotion |
| Deploy guard | `/deploy.guard #dev-only #approval-gate @operator @dev-only` | Local-only status | No Prod or Cloudflare mutation |

## MVP Value

| Persona | Job | First value | Time-to-value target |
|---|---|---|---|
| SME owner | Know what's exposed and what's not covered right now | Visual REG with red (uncovered) vs green (covered) edges | Under 3 minutes after redacted profile entry |
| SME owner (growing) | Get nudged before a gap becomes a denied claim | Plain-language milestone alert plus clinician-style "what changed, what to check" note | Immediate on next graph delta |
| Licensed broker (downstream) | Receive a pre-qualified, structured gap brief instead of a cold lead | Ranked gap list with market/sector context, ready for a bindable quote | Same session, post-approval |
| Solo builder | Prove a risk-copilot harness without cloud spend | Local Storyboard and validation packet | Same working session |

## Growth-Stage Trigger Map (Singapore-primary, MY/ID/CN-aware)

| Growth-stage milestone | REG delta detected | Typical coverage trigger | Jurisdiction note |
|---|---|---|---|
| First hire | New employee `@node` added | Work injury / employee compensation cover | Mandatory in Singapore (Work Injury Compensation Act); check MY (SOCSO) / ID (BPJS) equivalents |
| First office/warehouse lease | New premises `@node`, new asset `@edge`s | Public liability, property/fire cover | Landlord-mandated minimums vary by lease terms |
| First customer-data-handling tool | New SaaS/data-store `@node` | Cyber liability, data-breach response cover | PDPA (SG), PDPA (MY draft), UU PDP (ID) all raise breach-notification exposure |
| First cross-border vendor/logistics | New vendor `@node`, supply-chain `@edge` | Marine cargo / trade credit / supply-chain interruption | Cross-border customs and currency risk stack on top of coverage risk |
| First overseas market entry (MY/ID/CN) | New market `@cluster` | Local statutory cover + political/trade risk review | China entry often requires a locally licensed insurer, not a cross-border SG policy |
| Fundraise / key personnel dependency | New investor/board `@edge`, key-person flag | D&O liability, key-man insurance | Often a term-sheet condition, easy to miss until due diligence |

Each row is a candidate `probe.generate` branch: the copilot asks which milestone just happened (or is imminent), then walks the REG delta it implies.

## Harness Contract

```yaml
risk_copilot_local_harness:
  source: "@source.frontmatter + @source.body"

  default_result: "local risk-copilot packet; paid_call_count remains 0"
  live_result: "blank until @operator approves @approval-gate and returned evidence exists"
```

## Safety Boundaries

| Risk | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Binding quote, bind, or issue request | Stop and route to a MAS/BNM/OJK-licensed broker or insurer. |
| Claims dispute or denial interpretation | Explain the gap in plain language and prepare broker/insurer questions; do not adjudicate the claim. |
| Conflicting policy-wording or jurisdiction rules | Preserve the conflict and ask for licensed-broker clarification. |
| Real registry ID, bank/financial account, or credential input | Reject or redact before persistence, model calls, or sharing. |
| Live broker/insurer API, browser-auth, Prod, or Cloudflare action | Require explicit `@operator` approval and `@approval-gate` evidence. |

## Use

1. From a clean local canvas, run `npm run demo:risk-copilot -- --port <free-port>`.
2. Confirm Canvas View reports `2D Renderer: Storyboard`.
3. Replace the synthetic SME profile with operator-redacted business content only (headcount band, sector, lease status, vendor list, data tools, target markets — no registry IDs or financials).
4. Run `/source.normalize #frontmatter #no-hardcode @source.frontmatter @source.body`.
5. Run `knowgrph.probe.generate` with `thread_root_id=risk-copilot-demo`, `current_node_id=risk_source`, `recall_top_k=0`, `token_budget=1200`, and the redacted profile; optionally configure `KNOWGRPH_PROBE_TREE_MODEL` for Ollama-backed local generation, or the `sea-lion` multilingual adapter for MS/ID/ZH intake.
6. Run `knowgrph.probe.select` for the user-selected growth-stage option, then run `knowgrph.probe.evolve` after the branch resolves; keep the parent checkpoint materialized in `data/probe-tree`, require local-zero `cost_log` in both responses, and treat any returned incomplete-path status as a validation blocker.
7. Run `/harness.define /cost.audit #harness #token-economics @local-harness @cost-log` to activate the trigger engine and broker copilot.
8. With explicit `@operator` approval, run the marketplace matcher against the flagged gaps to produce a broker-handoff packet (no live insurer call without further approval).
9. Run `/canvas.project #canvas @canvas @runtime-proof` and review the Storyboard plus Rich Media panel.
10. Run `/validation.run #vcc @runtime-proof @dev-only`.
11. Keep `/deploy.guard #dev-only @dev-only` active unless the operator explicitly authorizes Prod or Cloudflare.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [x] Frontmatter parses from byte zero without repair fallback.
- [x] Clean-canvas demo mode loads this sibling docs source through `VITE_KNOWGRPH_RUN_READY_DEMO=risk-copilot`.
- [x] Source content is synthetic or operator-redacted; no registry IDs or financials.
- [x] `/`, `#`, and `@` tokens match the Agentic OS dictionaries.
- [x] Probe-tree tools are registered in local MCP and `probe.generate` does not mutate graph state.
- [x] `probe.generate` enforces `token_budget` before local model invocation.
- [x] `probe.generate` honors `recall_top_k=0` against a seeded memory store.
- [x] `probe.select` writes one fresh `type: probe` markdown node with a `branches-to` edge under `data/probe-tree`.
- [x] `probe.select` output parses through frontmatter-flow for existing Canvas/sync projection.
- [x] `probe.select` returns a local-zero `cost_log`.
- [x] `probe.evolve` writes one scoped memory exemplar without adding a second checkpoint datastore.
- [x] `probe.evolve` scores the complete traversed growth-stage path or reports missing parent checkpoints.
- [x] `probe.evolve` returns a local-zero `cost_log`.
- [x] Probe markdown parsing preserves semantic hyphen and dot frontmatter keys.
- [x] `probe.select` and `probe.evolve` are advertised as non-idempotent process tools.
- [x] Trigger engine fires only against declared Growth-Stage Trigger Map rows, no invented triggers.
- [x] Broker copilot drafts nudges but never auto-sends without `@operator` approval.
- [x] Marketplace matcher output is a broker-handoff packet, never a bindable transaction.
- [x] Harness fields include schemas, fallback, max iteration, circuit breaker, and cost log.
- [x] Local dry-run cost fields remain exact zero.
- [x] Storyboard and Rich Media projection use existing shared Canvas owners.
- [x] Rich Media HTML uses semantic elements and no generic container markup.
- [x] Safety gate blocks binding quotes, bind/issue actions, and claims adjudication.
- [x] Runtime-ready status is backed by focused proof.
- [x] Publish scope remains `local-only` unless the operator explicitly authorizes Prod or Cloudflare.

## Guardrails

- Do not hardcode UEN/registry numbers, real financials, provider IDs, credentials, generated policy documents, or runtime proof into repo code or tests.
- Do not add downstream aliases, compatibility remaps, duplicate registries, or renderer forks for risk-copilot routing.
- Do not backfill runtime-ready claims from prose, screenshots, or stale local state.
- Do not deploy this demo to Prod or Cloudflare from this document alone.
- Do not let the marketplace matcher or broker copilot represent its output as a licensed recommendation, quote, or bind — every downstream action requires a licensed broker/insurer and explicit `@operator` approval.
- Keep frontmatter as the source-owned graph and body prose as the human workflow.
